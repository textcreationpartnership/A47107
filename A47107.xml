            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff made an absolute Conveyance in Fée to the Defendant, by Lease and Release, of Lands worth <hi>1000 l. per annum</hi> in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>1000 l.</hi> The Plaintiff at the making the Conveyance had but the Reversion in Fee expectant on an old Life, which shortly after died; the Plaintiff then made Livery to the Defendant. The Bill was, That the said Conveyance was a Mortgage, and that he might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to redeem; The Proof was, That the Defendant had said several times after the Conveyance, <hi>That he knew not how long he should enjoy the said Lands,</hi> and had said
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42102:6"/>also, <hi>That he would take his Mony again with Damages.</hi> This was strongly urged by the Plaintiffs Council to be a Mortgage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Churchil</hi> of the Defendants Counsel insisted, that it is a Maxim,<note place="margin">Remedy for the Mortgagor and Mortagagee ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal.</note>
                  <hi>That none can come to redeem a Mortgage when the Mortgagee cannot compel the Payment of the Mortgage Mony; for the Remedy ought to be reciprocal.</hi> And in this Case the Defendant hath no remedy to inforce the payment of this Mony. And moreover he insisted, That if it were a Mortgage, it must be so à <hi>principio,</hi> either by a Condition in the Déed it self, or by an other collateral Déed made at the same time; for the Condition ought to be made and conceived at the same time with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.<note place="margin">A Poll Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance cannot make it a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, if not so at first.</note> And in the principal Case it was not said, that it was a Mortgage at first, but by Agréement subsequent, and then he said, that was a nude Agréement, and no manner of execution of it.</p>
               <p>The matter by consent was referred to be determined in an amicable way.</p>

The first year effluxeth, and the Plaintiff neither paid the Defendant his Mony nor the Colledge their Rent, and at three years end she permitted the Defendant to enter upon the Premises and to enjoy them.

It appeared by one Witness that <hi>John Alford</hi> threé or four days before his death, which was before the Trust, and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trust, did acquaint that Witness that he had settled the Estate in <hi>Hams</hi> well, as he thought he could, and that his Brother Sir <hi>Edward Alford</hi> was by an Agreément between them to have all his Estate there after his death, and that he thereout appointed some allowance to his Daughter <hi>Everfield,</hi> and declared that his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (now Wife of the Defendant <hi>Bickerstaff</hi>) was not to have any thing out of his Estate there, for that he had otherwise provided for her. <hi>John Alford</hi> the Night or the same Day the Demise and Declaration bore date, dyed without Issue Male, leaving the Daughters his Heirs.

The Defendant Dame <hi>Ann,</hi> as Administratrix of Sir <hi>Edward Alford</hi> Defendant, <hi>John Alford</hi> as first Son and Heir of Sir <hi>Edward Alford</hi> Defendant, <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staff</hi> and his Wife in her right, she being one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs of <hi>John Alford,</hi> and Executrix of <hi>Frances,</hi> who was the Executrix of <hi>John Alford,</hi> and <hi>John Everfield,</hi> as Heir
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42102:8"/>to <hi>Jane,</hi> Co-heir with <hi>Elizabeth Bickerstaff,</hi> claimed the benefit of the Trust during the residue of the one and twenty years after <hi>Frances</hi> her death; so the Plaintiffs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trustees, <hi>ut supra,</hi> the Defendants all claiming the benefit of the Trust under several Titles, The Bill was to have the Defendants enterplead, and to desire the direction of the Court, to whom the Trust belonged.</p>
               <p>Vpon the first Hearing by the Master of the Rolls, <hi>2 Novemb. 13 Car. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inasmuch as the power reserved to <hi>John Alford</hi> by the Lease is, That after the death of <hi>Frances</hi> the Trustees should permit and suffer such person and persons as he should nominate, and after the death of the nominee his own right Heirs to receive the Profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Court was of Opinion, That <hi>John Alford</hi> had no power to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate any person to receive the Rents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but during the Life of the nominee and no longer; for after the nominees death the Heirs at Law are nominated by the original Deed to receive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when after by Deéd Poll Sir <hi>Edward Alford</hi> is appointed to receive the Rents, that must be intended if he so long liveth; for the Deed Poll reciteth the Lease, and is in pursuance of the Trust therein, and that <hi>John Alford</hi> his intention in the original Lease was plain,<note place="margin">Two Deeds of the same date touching one thing but one Assurance.</note> That after the death of the nominee his own Heirs should have the residue of the Trust; and both the Deeds being executed at one time are to be taken as one Assurance; and if he had meant the Heirs, Executors or Administrators of Sir <hi>Edward</hi> should have the remaining part after Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> he would have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them as well as Sir <hi>Edward;</hi> and for that the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Term was alwaies in the Plaintiff, and never any real or legal Interest in Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> but as nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee to receive the Profits, he being dead, the Trust to him ceaseth, and nothing passeth to his Heirs or Executors, but remaineth to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the surviving Daughter, Heir and Executrix to <hi>John Alford,</hi> and the testimony of that one Witness can be intended to relate to no other Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but the first by Deed and Fine, and not the Trust of the Lease,<note place="margin">Heir at Law to be preferred in a doubtful case.</note> which was not in being when the said <hi>John Alford</hi> had the discourse with that Witness, but was made the day of his death, and that the residue of the Term of one and twenty years doth belong to the Heir at Law of <hi>John Alford,</hi> who in a doubtful case ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, especially when it is so consonant to <hi>John Alford</hi>'s
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42102:9"/>intention, and the Defendant <hi>Bickerstaff</hi> is also his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutrix and Daughter, and doth therefore order and decrée the same accordingly, and that the Rents arrear and for the future be paid to the Defendant <hi>Bickerstaff</hi> during the Coverture betwéen them, and after to the Defendant <hi>Elizabeth Bickerstaff</hi> during the residue of the Term.</p>
               <p>And upon the Appeal the question was upon the whole Case, Whether <hi>John Alford</hi> had power to dispose of the Trust of the whole Term of one and twenty years after the death of <hi>Frances,</hi> and how far he had power to dispose of it, and whether there were not a Restriction by the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the first Déed to the Heirs after the death of the Nomineé, that did disable his disposition thereof farther, except to his Heirs, and whether <hi>John Alford</hi> had disposed the whole Term or not, and which of the Parties ought to have the Remainder of the Trust.</p>
               <p>The Counsel of the Defendant <hi>Bickerstaff</hi> now offered farther, that <hi>John Alford</hi> had no power after two distinct Limitations to two several persons, to limit it to a third after the death of the second, because it would make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutory Devise upon an Executory Devise to tend to the intayling of a Chattel,<note place="margin">Executory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise.</note> and creating a Perpetuity, and that the Limitation of <hi>John Alford</hi> was out of the Power and Trust,<note place="margin">Perpetuity.</note> and not of any Interest in the Reversion of the Term.<note place="margin">Limitation in Reversion to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons in being doth not tend to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise if it be to a person not in being.</note> They did all agrée in one uniform Opinion, That the Limitation of a Term to several persons in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version one after another, if those persons were in being, and particularly named could in no wise tend to the intail of a Chattel or Creation of a perpetuity; but limiting of it to a person not in being, did; and that where any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had the Trust of a Possibility in Remainder of a Term, he had good power to declare and make a disposition of the Trust of such Possibility; but that the Limitation of such Remainder in Possibility of a Chattel real to the Heir of the person limiting was a void Limitation,<note place="margin">The Trust of a Possibility is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signable or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarable.</note> and the Estate in Interest did again revert to <hi>John Alford</hi> who made that Limitation, and he having by the Deed Poll the same day of the Lease,<note place="margin">On a void Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Estate reverts to the Limitor.</note> which was made pursuant to the power of the first Settlement, limited to Sir <hi>Edward Alford</hi> the whole remaining Term after the death of <hi>Frances</hi> without any other Limitation or Restriction,<note place="margin">Limitation of the Trust of a Term to one, good to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors.</note> which he might easily have done (if so intended) the same was a good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of it to Sir <hi>Edward</hi> his Executors and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrators; and if the power in <hi>John Alford</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42102:9"/>his Interest ought to come in aid and supply it to make good such Limitation,<note place="margin">The Interest of the Limitor is to supply his power if that be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</note> for otherwise there would be no disposition at all of the remaining Term, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies of <hi>50</hi> and <hi>60 l.</hi> to <hi>William Alfords</hi> Children would be avoided, and the Interest in the remaining Term might be pretended to be in the Trustees, and they claim the Estate discharged of the Trust, there being nothing to oppose the power or intention of <hi>John Alford</hi> in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the whole Remainder of the Term to Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> but the implicated, misplaced and mistaken expression of the Lease. The whole Court was clear of Opinion, that the former Decrée was grounded upon a mistaken foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and that taking both Deeds together, no other equitable or reasonadle Interpretation can be made thereof, but that according to the Power, Interest and Intention of <hi>John Alford,</hi> who it appears by one Witness never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Estate to whom it was decreed by the former Decree the whole remaining Term in the said Lease and Trust therein after the death of <hi>Frances,</hi> for the residue was well limited and appointed to Sir <hi>Edward Alford,</hi> his Executors and Administrators; and that the Defendant Dame <hi>Ann</hi> is well intituled thereunto, and doth order and decrée that the former Order and Decrée be discharged, and that the Plaintiffs shall come to an account for, and pay the said Dame <hi>Ann</hi> the Rents and Profits of the said Manor which are arrear and to grow due until the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Remainder of the said Term of one and twenty years, and convey to her for the residue of the Term, if so required, and in so doing shall be protected and saved harmless by the Authority of this Court, <hi>Vide Moors Reports 809.

               <p>The Defendants, <hi>Box</hi> and <hi>Stonehouse,</hi> pleaded, that the said Action still depended, which is a double vexation; and demur, and demand Iudgment, whether they as Heirs shall be charged in Equity, without any Trust or Agréement further than the Law chargeth them.</p>
               <p>On hearing thereof, a Case was stated on the Bill, Plea and Demurrer; and afterwards <hi>Henry Box</hi> died.

               <p>An Original was filed by the Plaintiffs against <hi>Henry Box</hi> and the other Defendants on the Bond in question in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> bearing <hi>Teste 14 Feb. 1659.</hi>

               <p>It was insisted on by the Plaintiffs Counsel that when Iudgment was had on the Bond, it remained no longer a Debt o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Bond, nor was Interest due on the Iudgment; so what was paid after must be taken as paid on the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if they had brought that <hi>1600 l.</hi> into Court at Law (and offered to pay it before Execution) the Court at Law would have accepted it. And therefore being willing to make up what was paid already the full of the Iudgment and Damages since the Iudgment, ought to be relieved against the Iudgment.</p>
               <p>On the Defendants part it was insisted, that there was more Mony due for Interest on the Bond, and that that was paid as well by those Obligors against whom there was no Iudgment, as by those against whom the Iudgment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42102:17"/>was; and what was paid by those against whom there was no Iudgment, there part of what was paid in by the course of the Court was to be taken as Interest, there being more Interest due on the Bond than the Mony paid; and there is no Equity in this Case to hinder the Defendant from recovering of what he can at Law, there being much more in Conscience due; and if what is justly due be to be received by any course of Law, no Equity ought to hinder it, so as he do not receive more than Principal Interest and Costs, which the Defendant offers to take on Account.</p>
               <p>It was replyed by the Plaintiffs Counsel, That one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by any of the Obligors, shall be a discharge at Law for the rest; and a Release to one Obligor is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to all the rest.<note place="margin">He that takes a Security by a Penalty ought not to have more.</note> And when a Man takes a Security by a penalty he sets up his Rest there, and makes himself Iudge of what he would have, and ought not to have more. And after a long debate where the Case of <hi>Whitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> and <hi>Underhil</hi> was cited, it was ordered that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs do pay so much, with what was paid, as will make up the Penalty of the Iudgment and Damages at <hi>6 l. per Cent.</hi> for the Penalty and Costs here and at Law, and thereupon the Bond to be delivered up, and the Iudgment vacated:<note place="margin">Monies paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of the Iudgment is to be taken as paid on the Bond tho' the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be of a Term before the payment.</note> But with this Proviso, that if <hi>250 l.</hi> paid in <hi>November 1662.</hi> were paid before the Iudgment entred into, and the Iudgment entred after of that Term, that that must be taken as paid as Interest, because the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant received it on the Bond, the Iudgment then not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred, which a Master is to examine; and if he find it, to allow the same as paid on the Bond for Interest, and the Master to take the Account.</p>

               <p>And this was referred to Merchants.

               <head>Gervas Scroope <hi>an Infant against Sir</hi> Adrean Scroope. October 15.</head>
               <p>A Bill was to be relieved touching the Manor of <hi>Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and sets forth that <hi>Gervas Scroope</hi> deceased, Father of the Defendant, and Grandfather of the Plaintiff, was seized in Fée thereof, and devised the same to the Plaintiff and his Heirs, and that the Defendant having gotten all the Writings, laid claim to the same, and got into possession thereof, and did pretend that the said Manor was purchased heretofore in the Name of the said Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> and him, and to their Heirs, and that so; Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> had no power, being Iointenant, to devise the same, whereas his, the said Defendants Name was used in the said Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Trust for the said Sir <hi>Gervas,</hi> and the Purchase was made and the Mony paid by Sir <hi>Gervas,</hi> and that so the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42102:19"/>Defendants Title was but as a Trustée for Sir <hi>Gervas,</hi> and cousequently for the Plaintiff to whom Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devised the same.</p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded that the Premisses were the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>June 13 Car. 1.</hi> by good Conveyance in Law well executed for <hi>4600 l.</hi> really and <hi>bona fide</hi> paid, conveyed by <hi>J. S.</hi> to Sir <hi>Gervas Scroope</hi> and the Defendant and their Heirs, the Defendant being the Son and Heir apparent of Sir <hi>Gervas,</hi> and that the said <hi>4600 l.</hi> was raised by Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> by sale of the Lands, which were the ancient Inheritance of the Family, and which, if they had not béen sold, had descended on the Defendant, and averred that all the Courts of the said Manor that were kept in Sir <hi>Gervas's</hi> Life were kept in as well the Defendants Name as in Sir <hi>Gervas's</hi> Name, and that the said Conveyance to Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> and him was really and <hi>bona fide</hi> without any Trust for Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> or any other. And that Sir <hi>Gervas</hi> being dead the Defendant claimed the Premisses by Survivorship, and demanded Iudgment.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff did not attend, but was alledged to be out of Town, and prayed it might stand for another day. But the Court directing the Plea to be opened, which was done, and afterwards read, declared it clearly to be a good Plea, unless the Plaintiff could prove an express Trust; and if he could have done that, he ought to have replyed; but not having replyed, the Plea must be taken to be true; and that albeit the Purchase was made by the Father in his own and his Sons Name,<note place="margin">The Father joyns the Son with him in the Purchase, it shall not be presumed a Trust in the Son, unless it be expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</note> it should <hi>prima facie</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an advancement for the Son, and not presumed a Trust, unless declared so, and that it was anciently the way to join the Son in a Purchase to avoid Wardship. And the Case of <hi>Crisp</hi> against <hi>Prat, 3 Cro. 550.</hi> and Sir <hi>Sidney Montagues</hi> Case there, were in the Debate of this Case urged, and the Court declared to the Defendants Counsel, this being the Case, that nothing could be said against the Plea, and so allowed it. <hi>17 November, 1663,</hi> the Plea was re-heard, and upon Argument on both sides was allowed with double Costs.</p>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42102:23"/>
               <p> The Cognizée pleaded that he having extended his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and the Cognizor and he stated Accounts, and the sum of <hi>3000 l.</hi> being due to him, he in consideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had an absolute Conveyance of part of the extended Lands, and shewed what Lands were conveyed to him by the Cognizor, and that thereupon he assigned the residue of the extended Lands to the Cognizor, and that so he was a Purchaser without notice of the Plaintiffs Title for a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable consideration.</p>
               <p>It was also pleaded that the Cognizor was in Execution on the Plaintiffs Iudgment, and so the Plaintiff could not extend the Lands, nor the Lands be lyable during the life of the Cognizor.</p>
               <p>On the Plaintiffs part, it was to the first point insisted, That it did not appear that the Defendant was a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser, there being no new Mony paid upon the executing the Conveyance, but coming in for the consideration of Mony due on the Statute was no Purchase. And that it was Common Equity for him that had the subsequent Iudgment to be relieved against the precedent Statute on payment of what was due, and that there was, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, no more there; and that the Account made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen the Cognizor and Cognizée on the pretended Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, ought not to affect the Plaintiff; and that therefore the Defendants Purchase, being subsequent to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Security, ought not to be aided by the Statute; and that the Plaintiffs Iudgment being of Record, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was bound to take notice thereof at his peril; and that in this Case the Defendant ought not to protect his pretended subsequent Purchase by his precedent Statute, but that he ought, upon payment of the Statute, to yield Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session to the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>But this was strongly opposed by the Defendants Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, who insisted that the Defendat was a Purchaser, and that though no new Mony was advanced on the Purchase, yet he assigned over and parted with part of the extended Lands in consideration thereof, which was as valuable as Mony.<note place="margin">Purchaser shall protect his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase by buying in an eigne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance.</note> And that it was the constant Iustice of this Court, That if a Purchaser <hi>bona fide</hi> did buy in an eigne Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, Statute or Iudgment, and there were a Iudgment or Statute mesne betwéen that and his Purchase, of which he had no notice at his Purchase, That he should protect his Purchase with the eigne Incumbrance so bought in.

And upon this Point the Plea was allowed.

               <p>THE Bill was to explain a Decree, wherein the Case was, One seised of the Manor of <hi>Wrangle</hi> worth near about <hi>110 l. per annum,</hi> and another of a Farm in <hi>Wrangle</hi> held of the same Manor, worth <hi>250 l. per annum,</hi> and the Fee of both came after into one Persons Hands, he having articled to settle the Manor of <hi>Wrangle</hi> worth <hi>110 l. per annum</hi> with the Improvements. It was on the Articles decreed, his Heir should convey the Manor of <hi>Wrangle,</hi> with all the Improvements to the Plaintiff in the first Suit; And if the Manor was not worth <hi>110 l. per annum,</hi> it should be made up out of the other Lands. By this Decree and unity of possession of the Manor and Farm the Plaintiff claimed all the Manor and Farm, and the Bill being to explain the Decree, charged the Farm to be worth <hi>250 l. per annum,</hi> and the Manor <hi>110 l. per annum,</hi> and therefore prayed to have the Decree explained, whether the Decree intended all, or only the Manor according to the Articles. The Demurrer was, for that it was an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Bill, and sought to alter or change the Decree.</p>
               <p>For the Plaintiff it was insisted, That the Plaintiff was without any possibility of help but by this Bill, for that it being to be relieved upon a Fact not in Issue, nor appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the former Cause, a Bill of Review would not lie for it; and that the Defendant by having demurred, had admitted the Bill to be true, and then the Case was, that the Lands claimed without the Decree were worth <hi>400 l. per annum,</hi> whereas the Articles on which the Decree was founded, were but for <hi>110 l. per annum,</hi> and therefore it was strongly urged, that they ought to answer.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Original Bill not to be admitted to explain a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree upon a Fact precedent.</note>For the Defendant it was replied, that no Original Bill ought to explain a Decree upon any matter precedent to the Decree; and the consequence of that was alledged to be dangerous; for it would be introductive of a means to blemish and hinder the execution of a Decree. And as to the hardship of the Decree, or intent of it, it was insisted, that that would be fit for determination upon an Execution for non-performance, where the Defendant might set out what he had to say for his excuse, and then it would be proper for the Court to declare what was the intent of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and that the Iustice or injustice of the Decree might then be determined. And of this Opinion the Court seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be. But the Plaintiffs Councel insisting, that the Defendant would be bound in a Prosecution on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by the Letter of it, and could not then put any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation on it against the Letter of it, they therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave of the Court to set forth the Special Matter on Examination; which the Court would not give an Order for. And as to the Plaintiffs Objection, that the Demurrer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Bill, and so ought to have an Answer, because the Manor and Lands were of the value, <hi>ut supra,</hi> It was answered by the Defendants Councel,<note place="margin">Non debet alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari quod proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non relevat</note>
                  <hi>Alligari non debuit, quod probatum non relevat,</hi> and the Demurrer was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then the Plaintiffs Councel prayed the signing and inrolling of the dismission on the Demurrer might be stayed till the Plaintiff was examined on Interrogatories for breach of the Decree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Court denied it.</p>

               <p>In <hi>1659. William Ibson</hi> dyed, having made his Will; After his death his Relict entred and held the Lands, and then upon agreement with his Executors for Mony paid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased to them the Personal Estate of the Testator, and all demands for the same. Soon after the King being restored, the Title of the Inheritance under the said Purchase became void. The Widow married the Plaintiff, and they two brought their Bill against the Executors of <hi>William Ibson</hi> and the Assignees and Trustees of the Lease, and it was to the end that though the Inheritance was evicted they might hold for so long of the Term as the Ioynturess should live,<note place="margin">A Release set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side by a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Accident having relation to the Original Equity.</note> and that the Release might not bar her of that, because not intended when the Release was given, nor was the Lease then looked on as part of the Personal Estate.</p>

               <p>Resolved in this Case, It being a Settlement in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and so on a Consideration, it should go to the Wife for so many years as she lived. But it was said, it would have been an other Case between the Heir and Executor of the Covenantees.</p>

               <p>THE Bill was to have a Decree for an Inclosure upon an Agreement.

               <p>Whereunto it was answered by the Plaintiffs, That tho' there were eighteen shares, some of the Persons were to have two shares, so as that made up the eighteen, and that there were others had Common but by Vicinage; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this appear'd to be alledged by the Plaintiffs.</p>

This Cause was through Infancy of the Defendant so delayed, that their Answers could not be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and through absence of the Plaintiff out of <hi>England</hi> which was nigh ten years; and now it was decreed, that if the Plaintiff would redeem, he should pay all the Arrears and Interest.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi>Fountain</hi> drew a Petition to the Master of the Rolls to Rehear it on the point of Interest, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moved it in Court; and the Lord Keeper (the Master of the Rolls being present) recommended it to him to Rehear it;<note place="margin">Mortgagee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits by Will partof the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Mony, and all the Interest if the rest be paid in three years. The Mortgagor failing to pay within 3 years loses the benefit of the bequest.</note> and as to the point of the <hi>100 l.</hi> of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal which was to be abated by Will, the Bill came within six months after the death of <hi>Ann,</hi> and it was not safe to go to Hearing without the Trustees, whereby to have a Surrender, and they were in Infancy and Lunatick, which was the principal reason the Cause depended so long. Sergeant <hi>Fountain</hi> did upon a Discourse between him and <hi>A. B.</hi> agree it was against the Plaintiff as to the <hi>100 l.</hi> (tho <hi>Churchil</hi> was clear of another Opinion,) for Sergeant <hi>Fountain</hi> said, That it being a voluntary Conditional Gift, the Plaintiff ought, if he would have the benefit of it, to have performed it by payment within three years, and sought a reconveyance after. But as to the matter of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, that was stronger, for that the Will appointed, that the Arrears being paid, the Land should be surrendred to the Plaintiff; and it was said the Testator intended a benefit to the Plaintiff by the appointment; and if he should pay
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42102:31"/>the Arrears and Interest, it was no benefit, for then the Premises without such appointment ought to be surrendred to the Plaintiff, for the same were not forfeited above ten years when the Bill was exhibited.</p>
               <p>The Master of the Rolls upon the Rehearing <hi>25 June, Car. 2.</hi> confirmed the first Decree. Sergeant <hi>Fountain,</hi> Master <hi>Churchil,</hi> and Master <hi>Keck</hi> for the Plaintiff. Master Sollicitor <hi>Finch</hi> and divers others for the Defendants. And afterwards there was a Bill of Review to reverse this Decree, to which <hi>Portington</hi> demurred, and insisted there was no Error in the Decree. And this Demurrer was argued in <hi>Trinity-Term 1665.</hi> before the Lord Chancellor and Baron <hi>Rainsford.</hi> And in the debate it was insisted by the Defendants Councel that this was a Bill of Review of a strange nature; for that the Plaintiff, who had the Decree, did by his Bill of Review complain, that he had not enough decreed; whereas if a Review lies, it lies only for him against whom the Decree or Dismission is. After long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Demurrer was over-ruled.</p>

               <p>THE Bill was a Bill of Review, and in drawing up the decretal Order, the matter upon which the Decree was made, was declared to be proved, and the Case stated far different from the Fact.</p>

               <p>THE Defendant having answered the Bill of Reviver, which sought to revive the Order on hearing, as to so much as was not within the Decree inrolled, had by his Answer set forth Matter that tended to draw into question and new examination an Agreement which was contended within the Decree as it was inrolled, and thereby fully setled. Therefore to so much of the Answer as tended again to draw into examination the Matters setled by the Decree inrolled, or by the Order, on Hearing, the Plaintiff did demur, for that it would be of evil consequence, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Perjury to permit a Re-examination of any of those Matters. Vpon debate of this Demurrer, which was drawn by Sergeant <hi>Fountain,</hi> it was averred by the Defendants Councel,<note place="margin">Demurrer to an Answer.</note> that a Demurrer to an Answer was never known before in a Court of Equity (tho Sergeant <hi>Glyn</hi> for the Plaintiff affirmed he had known of a Demurrer to an Answer before) And tho it did seem unreasonable to the Court that a Defendant should not by Answer draw again into examination the Matters formerly examined unto and setled, yet the Court doubted what to do as to the Demurrer. Some at the Bar said the Court should have been moved in this Special Case for an Order to restrain an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Matters formerly examined and setled. And it was now ordered that there should be no Matters re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that were examined to before. This I take it was the Rule that was given, <hi>tamen quaere.</hi>

               <p>Vpon hearing of which Cause in <hi>Novemb.</hi> following it was ordered and decréed by the consent and agréement of the Parties, that the then Plaintiffs should pay all the Arrerages of the said Rents at <hi>160 l. per ann.</hi> and that upon payment thereof the said <hi>Bevis</hi> should reconvey the said mortgaged Premisses unto the then Plaintiffs, or to whom they should appoint; and to that end did appoint an Account to be taken by Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> then one of the Masters of this Court, and what he should find due was to be paid, <hi>200 l.</hi> thereof at <hi>Christmas</hi> then following, and the residue at the end of six Months and six Months then next following, by equal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Pursuant to which Order the said Master certified there was due to the said <hi>Bevis</hi> the Sum of <hi>4640 l.</hi> which Sum was made up of Interest during the late Troubles at <hi>8 l. 10 s. per Cent.</hi> which said <hi>200 l.</hi> was duely paid at the time prefixed for that purpose. But the Plaintiff being a Colonel in the Kings Army, and about the time allowed for the latter payments being engaged in his Majesty's Service at <hi>Worcester,</hi> was forced to leave the Kingdom, and thereby disabled to make satisfaction according to the Decreé. Nevertheless did write to the said <hi>Bevis</hi> to sell part of the said Lands and pay himself what was due to him, who accordingly sold unto Sir <hi>James Thynn</hi> and others so much of the said Premisses as raised the whole
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42102:36"/>Mony, and yet continued the Possession and received the whole Profits of the residue of the Lands, and about four years since dyed, whereby the said Premisses came unto the Defendant his Son, as Administrator of the said <hi>Peter Bevis</hi> his Father, who continues the Possession thereof; Therefore that the said Defendant might come to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with the Plaintiff for the mesne Profits by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that he may reconvey the mortgaged Premisses to the Plaintiff, or to whom he shall appoint, he being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to satisfie the Plaintiff if any thing shall be found due to him on account, is the scope of the Bill.</p>
               <p>Whereunto the Counsel for the Defendant insisted, that there was such a Decrée as in the Bill set forth, and that for the Nonpayment of the mony computed due, which consisted only of the Arrears of Rent, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest for the same, the said Decrée became absolute: Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the said Defendant rested satisfied, and the Sale made to Sir <hi>James Thynn</hi> was not pursuant to such Letter sent by the Plaintiff, but sold on the said <hi>Peter Bevis's</hi> own account, and wherein the said <hi>Peter Bevis</hi> hath given a general Warranty, wherein he hath bound himself and his Heirs in perpetuity; which he would not have done for a thrid persons advantage.</p>
               <p>This Court nevertheless after long debate of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hearing what could be alledged by Counsel on either side, and reading of the whole Proofs taken in this Cause, and of the Decrée made in the former Cause, which appeared to be made by consent, was fully satisfied that the Decrée was in the nature of a Mortgage,<note place="margin">Decree in nature of a Mortgage.</note> and but a Security for Mony, although the same was made abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and the said Lease to Mr. <hi>Bevis</hi> confirmed: And inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Consent and Agréement of the said Parties was in part executed by the payment of the said <hi>200 l.</hi> and the Conditions of the Times being then such, that as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the Defendants own proofs, that part of the Lands could not be sold, by which the Plaintiffs could not make satisfaction of the said Decreé, notwithstanding a continued endeavour appeared in the Plaintiffs to that purpose, as his desire of Sale of part of the said Premisses to Sir <hi>James Thynn,</hi> and Sale made by the said Mr. <hi>Bevis,</hi> and much Monies received by him by Fines and otherwise, of some of the Tenants of the said Manor: And it also appearing that this Court hath very often in such like Cases of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable necessity, and no wilful default appearing in the

               <p>The Argument on Sir ..... <hi>Smiths</hi> part was thus; Either the Profits taken by the Lady and <hi>Lloyd</hi> were taken by Right (for there was a pretence she entred on the Lands as part of her Ioynture) or by Wrong; If by Wrong, then <hi>Lloyd</hi> the Wrong-doer being dead, the Tort was dead with him, and so there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to be answered for that Wrong; and compared this Case to a Trespasser, and the Trespasser dead.

               <p>Sergeant <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Heir insisted, that both by Law and Equity Sir ..... <hi>Smith</hi> and the Lady were answerable for the Profits taken by the Lady, and after by <hi>Lloyd;</hi> As if Feme <hi>Tenant pur vie</hi> marry, and the Husband doth wast and dies, Wast lies against the Wife. And compared it to the Case where a Feme Executrix takes a Husband that wasts the Testators Estate, a <hi>Devastavit</hi> lies against the Feme after the Husbands death for the wast of the Husband. And the Feme by her entring and meddling had made her self liable to answer what she had took as a Debt; and <hi>Lloyd</hi> her Husband upon his Marriage continuing to take the Profits as she did, its a continuance of the Wrong she did, and by colour of her having entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and taking the Profits, made her liable for her own Receipts, as a Debt owing by her. And her Marriage
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42102:46"/>with, <hi>Lloyd</hi> which is her own Act, cannot discharge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and the Husband must be looked upon as acting in this Case, by reason of the Wifes so acting before. And so upon the whole Matter the Court conceived the Decree just, and that Sir ..... <hi>Smith</hi> must take his Wife chargeable with this Debt. But for the proof, that the Mother and the Son were related to the Earl of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> it was referred to him to moderate the matter if he could; if not, then directed a Case to be made.</p>

The Elder Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed there was no Recovery upon Record, and so the Devisor could not devise the Freehold Lands from him, and he being in truth intituled to the Copyhold as Heir at Law, and now by the Will, no Surrender being made to the use of it, brought his Action at Law to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Freehold Lands. The Younger Brother exhibits his Bill upon the Agreement, and pretends there was a Recovery, howbeit the Record was imbizelled, and prays he may hold according to the Agreement between him and his Brother.</p>
               <p>And upon heating at the Rolls it was decreed, that he should enjoy the Freehold Land, and an Injunction award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to stay the Elder Brothers Suit.</p>
               <p>From this Decree the Elder Brother appealed by Bill of Review, and upon hearing of the Bill of Review, it was insisted for the Plaintiff therein, That the Agreement between the two Brothers was <hi>parol</hi> only, and that the pretence of a Recovery was a Fraud, there being none, and that if there was an intention, and it was never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that intention can never found a Decree against the Statute <hi>de Donis,</hi> and that the Agreement doth not alter the Case, it being introduced by Fraud, there being in truth no Recovery, nor no Surrender of the Copyhold to the use of the Will. So that the Plaintiff in a Bill of Review ought to have both Freehold and Copyhold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Decree. The question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Recovery shall bar or not, but whether here is not enought to fortifie and excuse the Agreement.<note place="margin">Where an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement tho conceived upon mistake, shall bind the Party.</note> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted farther, that the Plaintiff had departed from his Title to the Freehold Lands; and tho the Agreement was not sealed, yet it was under Hand, so that the certainty of it was not to be disputed, and so replied upon the Agreement, and that in that respect the Decree was well grounded, and thereupon the Bill of Review was dismist with Costs, for <hi>modus &amp; conventio vincunt Legem.</hi> So that in this Case the Agreement of the Party upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit he had not (when in truth he had) a Title to permit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42102:48"/>another to enjoy Lands, shall for ever bind him; and yet this Agreement doth appear to be upon a valuable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Argument <hi>pro &amp; contra.</hi> Sequestration.</note>THERE having béen a Decrée in this Case for a personal Duty, and a Sequestration awarded against the Defendants real and personal Estate by the late Lord Chancellor, assisted by Baron <hi>Turner,</hi> it was now moved by the Defendants Counsel against this Sequestration, and insisted, that this Court did not anciently grant any Sequestration but sparingly, and that only of the thing in demand, and that the Sequestration in this Case took more than all the Executions at Law; and that Sequestration had been extended so far of late as to sequester things in Action, which no Execution at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law can reach, and the consequence of which would be destructive to Trade and Commerce. And besides when any Purchaser is brought into this Court upon the Process of Sequestration upon Sequestration, That this Purchase is subsequent to the Sequestration, or for other reason bound thereby, whereas many persons so brought in are really Purchasers, or have other good Titles, which neither are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42102:51"/>nor ought to be bound thereby, those persons so brought in are looked upon as Contemners and Delinquents and forced to answer Interrogatories blindfold without having a Copy of them, or liberty to shew them to Counsel, by which means persons coming into this Court to defend their Interest are often through their own unskilfulness concluded in their just Rights, even against Right, to the great dishonour of the Court and of Iustice. But to maintain the Sequestration it was insisted by <hi>Fountain,</hi> That they were very ancient in this Court, and cited a Case <hi>17 Jac. Zacheverel</hi> against <hi>Zacheverel,</hi> where a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration was awarded both against Lands and Goods,<note place="margin">Sequestration against Lands and Goods.</note> and the thing decreed was a personal duty; and this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration was awarded by the Court, assisted with the Iudges upon view of four Presidents. <hi>Russel</hi> against <hi>Read:</hi> The Defendant being in the <hi>Fleet</hi> the mony decreéd was sequestred, it being in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> this in the Lord <hi>Coventry's</hi> time. And <hi>18 Feb. 1662.</hi> assisted with Baron <hi>Turner</hi> in this principal Case and the Case of <hi>Beddingfield</hi> and <hi>Zouch,</hi> That a Sequestration should be the usual Process of this Court,<note place="margin">The Power of the <hi>Chancery.</hi>
                  </note> and the course of the Court is the Law of the Land, and an Executor might bring an Action here before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute gave it; and it was urged if you should take away Sequestration the Iustice of the Court would be elusory, and that after a Suitor had been at great Charges in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Decrée, if the Defendant would lye in prison there would be no remedy for the Plaintiff to come by the fruit of his Decreée, and the Remedy by Imprisonment would be ineffectual, for if he go abroad no Escape lies. Vpon a Iudgment in a Court Baron a <hi>Levari Fac.</hi> goes which takes all the Profits of the Lands, and a Statute before a Mayor takes all. And therefore not unreasonable that so great a Court as this should have an effectual means of bringing Suitors to the fruit of their Suit, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sequestration cannot be done.</p>
               <p>And as to sequestring things in Action there is no such thing sequestred in this Case. And as to the danger of bringing persons that came in for their Interest as Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents by means of Sequestration and their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Counsel to answer. That is the Case of every Decrée and Contempt where there is no Sequestration, and is the course there as well as in the course of Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42102:51"/>
               <p> The Court will see Presidents: <note place="margin">Sequestration against Lands and Goods well awarded.</note> And after at another time declared it was latisfied the Sequestration in the principal Case was well awarded; and that Sequestrations were a necessary Process of this Court.</p>

               <p>For the Plaintiff it was laid down by his Counsel as a Rule, <hi>That wh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And it was proved by Witnesses that the Defendant had said, He had trusted <hi>Yarway</hi> with the greatest part of his Estate, and he feared he should be cozened, which the Plaintiffs Counsel insisted on as Evidence to prove that the Defendant trusted <hi>Yarway</hi> with this Mony:<note place="margin">Whether Mony paid by the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower to the Scrivener that is imployed in lending of the Mony, without taking up the Security, be a good payment to conclude the Lenders.</note> But as to that it was answered by the Defendants Counsel, that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisby</hi> lent <hi>Yarway</hi> other Monies on his own Security which he lost, so might say, He was like to be cozened by the said <hi>Yarway.</hi> But it was farther insisted by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Counsel, that the Defendant kept the Security himself, which clearly shewed that <hi>Yarway</hi> did not act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such general authority as was alledged by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Counsel. And it was insisted, that that one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance would rule the Case; and no man will pay the Mony due upon a Mortgage and Recognizance (no not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42102:52"/>on a Bond) without having the Security up and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mony by the Plaintiff to the Scrivener with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having up his Security, was an Evidence that he did trust the Scrivener more than the Defendant did (who always kept the Security himself) and he that trusted most is to be cozened.</p>
               <p>A Case betweén Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> was cited by the Defendants Counsel where Mony was paid to one that did usually receive for the Obligée, yet the Obligée not trusting the Receiver with the Bond, it was held no good payment.</p>
               <p>The Court conceives the Case is against the Plaintiff in regard the Defendant kept the Security, but will seé Presidents, <hi>English</hi> against <hi>Lee,</hi> a President cited by the Plaintiff in <hi>1655.</hi> And after the Court had perused the Presidents on both sides, <hi>Pasch. 1668.</hi> Iudgment was given for the Defendant, That the payment to the Scrivener should not conclude him; but he was ordered to take the Principal without Costs.</p>

               <p>To be relieved against which was the Bill which did suggest that the Timber that was cut was worth but <hi>40 s.</hi> and the Estate <hi>60 l. per annum,</hi> and that there was <hi>300 l.</hi> worth of Timber standing, and that if upon Examination it should appear to be wast, the Plaintiff would make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The Defendant <hi>Porter</hi> by Answer insisted, that the Wast was voluntary, and declared to be so by the Iudge
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42102:53"/>of Assize before whom the Iudgment was, and that the Timber felled was worth <hi>60 l.</hi> Vpon the Proofs there was a great difference touching the value of the Timber felled, and some proof of a Load or two of Boards that were carried off the Premisses by the Plaintiff, which for her was insisted were carried to another Copyhold within the same Manor; but there was not any proof, that the Plaintiff had sold any of the Timber she felled; and it was proved the Copyhold in Question was much out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and for the Plaintiff insisted, that with that Timber she intended to repair the same.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper.</hi> It was not clear there was any wilful Forfeiture, for that the Defendants before the Plaintiffs had applied the Timber, took the Forfeiture, and the Defendants were ever forward therein, and yet withal declared, that in case of a wilful Forfeiture he would not relieve, and then referred the Cause to the Bishop, the Defendant, to be Chancellor in this Cause.</p>
               <p>Vpon this the Bishop certified the Wast of be wilful, and no ground to relieve the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>The Question was betwéen the Heir and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>B.</hi> who shall have the Remainder of the fiftéen years after the Debts paid and Trusts performed. For the Heir it was said there was a difference betwéen this Term, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Inheritance, and a bare Chattel, and that the Overplus of this Term being out of the Inheritance should attend it, and there was not any intention in the Testator to give the Executor the Profits for fifteen years otherwise than to make provision for payment of his Debts and those other Trusts; and that the end being satisfied the residue of the Term did cease and return to the Inheritance.<note place="margin">Whether the Overplus of the Profits of a term devised out of an Inheritance, in Trust to pay Debts to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduary Legatee, doth belong to the Heir or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor.</note> But for the Executor it was insisted that the fiftéen years was a Term, and then the Devise of the residue of the Goods and Chattels did pass.</p>

                  <hi>Curia.</hi> The Term is in the Devisée, and there passed an Interest, and if it had been devised the Executor should take the Profits for fiftéen years; and then the appointing the Debts to be out of the Profits, and the other Trusts both not alter it, so conceives the residue of the Term be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Executor, and not to the Heir; and so decréed, <hi>Tamen quaere.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>James Waad</hi> the Defendants Father having married a first Wife, did in her Life time many years befor ther death, by several Fines and Déeds settle the several Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>Buttles</hi> and <hi>Payton Hall,</hi> to the use of himself for Life, Remainder to his first and all other his Sons in Tail. Afterwards the first Wife dies without Issue; then <hi>James Waad</hi> marries with the Daughter of <hi>Eltonhead,</hi> but before Marriage agreés with <hi>Eltonhead</hi> that in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>1000 l.</hi> Portion, which <hi>Eltonhead</hi> was to pay her, to settle her a Ioynture of <hi>300 l. per annum,</hi> (of which it appeared in the Case <hi>Buttles</hi> Manor was to be part) but what the other Lands were that were to make up the <hi>300 l. per annum</hi> did not appear. <hi>James Waad</hi> hath Issue by his second Wife the Defendant, and dyed, leaving the second Wife, who married <hi>Douglasse</hi> the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Their Bill is against the Defendant to have him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to settle the Ioynture on the Defendants Mother, and to set aside the Settlement made by <hi>James Waad</hi> against the Ioyntress as fraudulent.</p>
               <p>When this Case was first brought to hearing there was no proof of payment of the <hi>1000 l.</hi> Portion by <hi>Eltonhead,</hi> but it proved that <hi>Eltonhead</hi> maintained <hi>James Waad,</hi> and furnished him with Mony for other Vses.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Marriage a good consideration to make a Feme a Purchaser. Security of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase Mony is payment.</note>And it was insisted on the Plaintiffs part, that Marriage was a good consideration to make the Ioyntress a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser, and it was her Father that was to pay the <hi>1000 l.</hi> and not she, and so she was clearly a Purchaser.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">But <hi>prima facie</hi> its presumed to be fraudulent.</note>To which it was replyed, Fraud is only cognizable here, and was only proper here before the Statutes, and every voluntary Conveyance is presumed to be fraudulent unless he, that claims by it, can prove the contraty.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor inclines, the Ioyntress is a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser, and whether the Déed be fraudulent proposes to have it tried, but after referred to a Case. And a Case being stated to the effect <hi>ut supra,</hi> with this more, that there was a Release given by <hi>James Waad</hi> for the Portion <hi>25 Feb. 19 Car. 2.</hi> the Cause came to be heard before the Lord Chancellor and Baron <hi>Turner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which time the Court declared the Marriage was 'a good consideration to make the Feme a Purchaser; and besides upon the Release for the Portion it was clear she was a good Purchaser,<note place="margin">A voluntary Conveyance precedent, as to a Marriage A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, is fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> and that all voluntary Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are <hi>prima facie</hi> to be looked upon as fraudulent against purchasers, unless the contrary be made appear, and so decreeed the Settlement by <hi>James Waad</hi> to be set aside as fraudulent.</p>
               <p>The Defendant brought a Bill of Review, and assigned for Error, that it was not cognizable here whether a Déed were fraudulent, but that was only tryable at Law; and besides no colour of Fraud against the Iointress; for the Déed, as appears by the Decrée, was made in the Life of the first Wife, who lived ten years after, and the second Wife not then thought on. And the Settlement being by Déed and Fine, ought not to be presumed fraudulent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof: And it was farther assigned for Error, that by the Decrée the Settlement as to <hi>Payton Hall</hi> was to be part of the Ioynture, she was not, as appeared, any Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser as to that, and so no reason to set aside the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to <hi>Peyton Hall,</hi> under the notion of the Ioyntress being a Purchaser, for that it did not appear that that was within her pretended Purchase.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42102:55"/>
               <p> To this Bill of Review the Defendants demurred, and insisted that the Decreé was well grounded, and upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate thereof before the Lord Chancellor and Baron <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi> Vacation <hi>19 Car. 2.</hi> The Demurrer, as to the Points above, was allowed.</p>
               <p>But as to another particular touching the mesne profits (which Point I have not stated) the Plaintiff in the Bill of Review was upon arguing of the Demurrer relieved, and the Decrée so far explained (that is to say) Whereas by the Decrée the Defendant was to Answer, and pay all the Arrears of the <hi>300 l. per annum</hi> to the Ioyntress since his Fathers death, whereas it appears by the Decrée, that by a former Decree of the Court the mesne Profits had béen applyed first to the payment of <hi>Eltonheads</hi> Debts, and afterwards beén taken by the Lady <hi>Waad,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was neither charged as Heir or Executor to his Father, nor had any Assets to answer the Arrears.</p>
               <p>It was ordered that the Defendant should be chargable only with so much Arrears as he had received out of the Lands.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42102:57"/>the Premises as Issue in Tail by the Settlement as Son and Heir of his Father. The Mortgagee brought Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Defendant, and thereupon a Special Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>ut supra,</hi> and upon argument ruled against the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff; whereupon the Plaintiff being as well Executor as Heir to his Father, brings his Bill in Equity, suggesting the tripartite Deed antedated, and however to be meerly voluntary and fraudulent as to the Defendant, he not being the Issue of <hi>Blanch,</hi> and so not within the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tripartite Deed and Settlement, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff being a Purchasor, and the Defendants Father or Grandfather being taken by the Plaintiffs Father to be seised in Fee when they made the Mortgage.<note place="margin">Whether a legal defect in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a power may be supplied in Equity.</note> And it was farther insisted on by the Bill, That Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> having a power to charge the Premises with the payment of <hi>2000 l.</hi> and the Mortgage being for <hi>2000 l.</hi> tho it were by way of Conveyance of the Lands, and not by a charge of the Lands, and so according to strictness of Law not good, yet in Equity it ought to be taken as in Execution of the Power, and that nice legal Defect ought therefore to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in Equity to the Plaintiff who is in under a Purchaser.</p>
               <p>For the Plaintiff it was farther insisted, That Sir <hi>Nicholas's</hi> Power ought to be knit to his Interest, and so come in supply of his Interest to make the Mortgage good. And if a Person that hath power to charge Lands for a Sum of Mony, do for the like Sum convey Lands to an other, and covenant to make farther assurance, (as here,) Equity will compel him to execute his Power to the benefit of the Person from whom he hath received the Mony. And the Defendant was Heir to Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> and his Father,<note place="margin">Whether if a Man that hath power only to charge Lands, conveys them for so much as he hath power to charge them, which shall in Equity inforce him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his power to the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> and bound by their Covenant to farther the assurance.</p>
               <p>Whereunto it was answered by the Defendants Councel, That the Defendant does not claim as Heir to his Father or Grandfather, but by the Settlement, and that he was Heir Male of the Body of his Father, and was within the consideration of the <hi>2500 l.</hi> Portion which the Grandfather had, and which belonged to the Father; and however if that Settlement had not been made, the Defendant was Issue in Tail by the Settlement made by <hi>Edward Kemis</hi> his Will. And it was farther insisted, that the Mortgage by which Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> had power to charge the Lands was dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he having conveyed all his Interest out of him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and that so he was disabled to execute his Power after. And it was also insisted for the Defendant, That Equity
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42102:57"/>in this Case ought to follow the Law, the Defendant claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by precedent Title to the Plaintiff in such manner, that there was no Equity to bind it farther than by Law it is bound;<note place="margin">Where a power to charge Lands shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of him that hath the power, and where not.</note> and in truth it did appear (howheit it was not found in the Special Verdict) that Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> did after the Mortgage to the Plaintiffs Father, in pursuance of his Power charge the Premises with <hi>2000 l.</hi> Debts which he owed, which Debts the Defendants Father paid accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>The Lord Keeper conceived the Power was not destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Mortgage, because it was by Lease and Release, and not by Fine or Feoffment. Yet both He and the Master of the Rolls were of Opinion that the Plaintiff could not be relieved in Equity.

               <p>THE Bill was, a Bill of Review to reverse a Decree made by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> for that by that Decree all Interest due on several Securities by Bond and Iudgments, and Costs at Law suffered before the first Bill in suing those Securities, were taken away upon a pretence that the Mony lent the Defendants by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Testator,<note place="margin">Errors assigned.</note> was paid by them to the King in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Farm of the Customs which they did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, whereas their Testator was not concerned in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and if disposing Mony by the Borrower, and any accident befalling it afterwards should create an Equity against the Creditor, it would destroy all Commerce. And by the course of the Court, which is the Law of the Court,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42102:58"/>where Interest is due on a Bond,<note place="margin">Where Interest is due on a Bond, and the Debtor pay any Sum less than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Interest only.</note> and the Debtor pay any Sum less than the Interest, the Payment is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Interest only, yet the Decree allows such Payments (although they were much less than the Interest than due) for Principal. And the Court hath also taken away the Plaintiffs Costs at Law, tho by the Decree <hi>800 l.</hi> is still due to the Plaintiffs on legal Securities, and the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Costs at Law were before any considerable part of the Principal was paid, taking the Interest for the Principal, as the Decree doth, so that the Proceedings were legal, and without those the Plaintiffs Testator could not recover his Debt, and so ought to be allowed those Costs.</p>
               <p>The Defendants demurred, and insisted that there is no Error in the Body of the Decree, nor new Matter to reverse it, and insist that this Court ever had a Power upon Circumstances to relieve against Penalties, Iudgments and Executions, and to abate and moderate, and sometimes discharge Damages and Costs.

               <p>THE end of the Plaintiffs Suit is to have the Redemption of a Mortgage, made by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and his Father <hi>James Morely</hi> Esq; in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1641.</hi> to <hi>Jerome Elwaies</hi> Father of the Defendants <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Henry.</hi>

This Decree being signed and inrolled, and the Plaintiff not able to perform the same, could not have a Bill of Review, nor could he be relieved by such Bill, if it had been brought, the Release barring all his pretences, and that being upon a secret Trust, he could not prove the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42102:59"/>Trust positively, the Witnesses being dead, and so he was not relievable neither in Law nor Equity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Plaintiff and Baron <hi>Greenvil</hi> Esq; petitioned the Lords House the last Sessions of Parliament for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief against the said Decree and Release. The Cause held many Debates at the Bar of the Lords house before <hi>Christmas 1667.</hi> The great Question being, Whether the Release was made in Trust, or <hi>bona side</hi> for a valuable consideration. The proofs offered to evidence the Trust were circumstantial, and not direct positive proofs. One thing offered by the Plaintiffs to evince the truth of their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Lordships in affirming the same to be only a Trust, was, That their Lordships would please to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Debts were due from the Plaintiff or his Father to the Defendant when the Release was made, and with that to take notice of the value of the Estate released at the time of the making thereof. As to the reading the Proofs to both these, the Parliament being to adjourn in two days, and there not being time, their Lordships ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the consideration of these two things, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proofs to the value of the Estate, desisted until their next meeting after <hi>Christmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Keeper <hi>present thus far.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the next meeting after <hi>Christmas</hi> the Lord Keeper being absent, the Lord Privy Seal sat on the Wool-pack, and the Cause had two days hearing when all the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs and Defendants Proofs were read to the values; and the House, after several days debate of the Matter, being satisfied that by the Proofs it clearly appeared that the value of the Lands was much greater than to make a satisfaction for the Debt for which it was released, did adjudge the said Release to be a farther Trust to pay <hi>80 l. per annum</hi> to the Comptroler for Life, and set aside the Decree aforesaid, and referred the Cause back to the Court to proceed as in the Case of an equitable Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, which their Lordships adjudged this to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lunae primo Junii 1668.</hi> This Cause was heard in Court, when a Decree was made for the Defendants to come to an Account, and the Plaintiff to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Redemption of his Estate: The ordering part is as followeth.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42102:59"/>
               <p> First, That <hi>Jeremy Elways</hi> come to an Account for all the Profits of the Lands in Question, which he or his Father, or any other to his or their use, or by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or appointment, have or might without their own wilful default have received. That Sir <hi>William Glascock</hi> should take the account, but with this direction, that in Case the Lands mortgaged in Fee were not a sufficient Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the Mony due to the Defendants Father, and for which he now stands engaged for them, and the pre-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was thereupon at the time of the Defendants Fathers taking the Sequestration over,<note place="margin">A Mortgage for an Estate for Life on an old Mortgage shall not account for more than the Estate had been worth to be sold.</note> and besides the other Lands mortgaged, in which at the time of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Entry and the Release made, the Plaintiff had only one Estate for Life, that then the Defendant shall be charged in the Account no more for the Lands held for the Plaintiffs Life than the Master shall really judge them to be worth, without respect to the benefit that hath happened by the continuance of the Plaintiffs Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Yet upon Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordered otherwise.</note>The Plaintiff grieved with this direction, procured a Re-hearing by the Lord Keéper, assisted with the Lord Chief Iustice <hi>Vaughan</hi> and Chief Baron <hi>Hales,</hi> and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this Order, and that in respect of the contingency of the Estate, and not for what was made, the Mortgage being above twenty years old.</p>
               <p>For the Plaintiff it was insisted, That this was a new direction without a President, and that it was safer to judge what was, than what might have beén; and that at this rate the Western Estates would not be mortgageable.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff by Petition complained of this direction to the Lords in Parliament, and upon a solemn Hearing at the Bar of the House, he was relieved; and the Lord Keéper ordered to direct the Mortgagée to account for the whole Profits of the Estate for Life, as in the Case of other Mortgagees.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Plaintiff having had great dealings with <hi>Smith</hi> the Testator, for Mault and other things bought by the Plaintiff, by that means he became indebted to the Defendants Testator in several great Sums, for which he gave him Security by Mortgage, Bond and otherwise.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Plaintiff became a great loser by the badness of the Mault he bought of the Defendants Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator, and other accidents, and thereupon <hi>Smith</hi> and he came to a new Agréement, that in consideration of <hi>80 l.</hi> lately before paid, and of <hi>70 l.</hi> paid on the Plaintiffs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half by one <hi>Tubbing</hi> the Plaintiffs Father-in-Law, and of <hi>40 l.</hi> more promised by <hi>Tubbing</hi> at a short day, that if the <hi>40 l.</hi> were paid accordingly, that then if the Plaintiff should pay <hi>Smith 800 l.</hi> in four years by <hi>200 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> that the said <hi>Smith</hi> would deliver up the Plaintiff all his Securities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mony was all paid to <hi>Smith</hi> the Testator but <hi>104 l.</hi> though not at a precise day; so to have those Securities up upon paying what was unpaid upon the last Agreement, with damages from the time it should have béen paid, is the scope of the Bill.</p>
               <p>In this Case it was insisted for the Defendant, that where a greater Sum is due by specialty, and a less agréed to be taken for it to be paid in certain Sums at certain days, if the Agréement be not strictly pursued, and the Monies paid precisely at those days,<note place="margin">Whether when a lesser Sum is agreed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at precise days in lieu of a greater, If he that is to pay, fails in payment at those days, he shall not have any benefit by that Agreement.</note> but part of the Mony paid at other days, a Court of Equity ought not to oblige him that made that Agréement (in favour of the person failing to perform it) to stand to it upon payment of so much as will make up the Mony paid since the last Agréement with Damages for the same from the respective times the same should have beén paid by that Agreément, to the times the same were paid, and Damages for what remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid, till the same be paid. But if the Plaintiff would have any benefit by the Agreement, he ought literally to have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42102:60"/>performed it, which was in his favour and without any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; and therefore insisted that the Plaintiff was not to have any benefit by that Agréement.</p>
               <p>The Baron ordered this matter to be made into a Case; but as yet nothing done therein. And it is to be observed in this Case, that part of the Consideration of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, that <hi>Tubbing</hi> (who was not obliged by any former Security) had paid <hi>Smith 70 l.</hi> and undertook to pay him <hi>40 l.</hi> more; so <hi>Smith</hi> bettered his Security, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE Bill did suggest, that by Inquisition taken before the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> by virtue of a Writ to him directed, the said <hi>Jerome Smith</hi> was the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>June, 1664.</hi> found a Lunatick, and had lucid intervals, and had not sufficient government of himself, his Lands and Goods; and that he was Lunatick the last of <hi>June, 1647.</hi> and during his Lunacy he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sums of Mony due to him which he had wasted, and alienated divers Goods, but to whom the Iurors were ignorant.

               <p>The Defendant sets forth by answer, that he sold the said <hi>Jerome Smith</hi> in <hi>1656.</hi> a Manor, which he much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to buy, at <hi>1200 l.</hi> it being the place of his Birth; <hi>Jerome Smith</hi> assigned <hi>Archibalds</hi> Debt for to satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Purchase Mony, and pay the Overplus to <hi>Smith,</hi> which he did, and did convey the said Manor to <hi>Smith,</hi> and insisted that <hi>Smith</hi> was not a Lunatick at that time, but did usually buy and sell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But for the Plaintiff it was insisted, that though a Vse could not rise as a Vse upon a Vse, yet as a Trust it would in Equity. And a Case was ordered to be made, which was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isaac Ash</hi> with his own Mony bought Lands of <hi>100 l. per annum,</hi> and took the Conveyance by Indenture in these words, Grant, Bargain, Sell, Alien, Enfeoff and Confirm to <hi>Isaac Ash</hi> his Executors and Assigns; To the use of <hi>Isaac</hi> for Life; Remainder as to one third to his Wife for Life, Remainder to <hi>Jacob Ash</hi> and to his Heirs (whose Heir the Plaintiff is) with a Letter of Attorny to make Livery. The Deéd is acknowledged and duly enrolled in <hi>Chancery.</hi> Two Months after Inrollment Livery is made and indorsed on the Deed. The Plaintiff and Defendants Wife were both Grandchildren to <hi>Isaac Ash,</hi> who by Lease and Release did convey the Lands in Question, the one moiety to the Plaintiff, and the other moiety to the Defendants and their Heirs; and the Plaintiff did not except to this dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in <hi>Isaacs</hi> Life, which if he had, <hi>Isaac</hi> would (as was insisted for the Defendants) have otherwise provided for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42102:62"/>them, he having given every Grandchild to the value of <hi>50 l. per annum,</hi> but the Defendants, to whom he gave nothing but the moiety of the Premisses.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Whether a Use upon a Use in a Deed inrolled be to be supported in Equity as a Trust.</note>For the Plaintiff it was insisted, that <hi>Isaac</hi> intended to take the Estate by Feoffment, and that the inrolling of it first was only for safe custody of the Deed; and that however the Vses upon a Vse would not rise in Law, yet in Equity they were good by way of Trust.</p>
               <p>For the Defendant it was argued thus upon private discourse of Counsel, that <hi>Isaac</hi> having by the Deed an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to take it either by Feoffment (which if he did, it would not be in his power otherwise to dispose it) or by Bargain and Sale, whereby he might have power to dispose the Estate as he pleased; and he having elected to take it by Inrolment, and disposed the same by Act executed in his Life, it was apparent he intended to take it so as to dispose it, and therefore no reason in Equity to make any other operation of this Conveyance than the Law made.</p>
               <p>There was some diversity of Opinion amongst Counsel touching this Case; but the Parties agréed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and it was not argued at all.</p>

And on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the matter of this Cause a Case betwéen <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Brograve</hi> about 1639. in this Court, was cited,<note place="margin">The Wife may not be suffered, though to good Uses, to dispose of any Mony she hath raised out of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Estate by Frugality.</note> which was thus.</p>
               <p>The Wife of an improvident Husband had unknown to him by her Frugality raised some Monies for the good of their Children, which she had disposed for that purpose, being otherwise unprovided for, and this disposition of the Wife the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> had established by Decrée. But afterwards upon a Review and Assistance of the Iudges
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42102:64"/>this Decrée was reversed, as being dangerous to give a Feme power to dispose of her Husbands Estate. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Case between <hi>Gorges</hi> and <hi>Chancy,</hi> which was about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term <hi>1639.</hi>

               <p>Baron and Feme by Agréement separated and lived apart,<note place="margin">A disposition by Feme Covert of Monies raised out of separate Maintenance good against the Husband.</note> and agreed that the Wife should have <hi>150 l. per annum</hi> separate Maintenance, out of which she had saved some Mony and put it out to Interest, and took Bonds in a Friends Name, and disposed the Mony by Will, and this upon Debate was established a good disposition; and this was now declared to be a just Order.</p>
               <p>But note, That in this Case it was an Agréement after Marriage with Friends in the behalf of the Wife for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Maintenance: But in the principal Case the Chief Baron declared, That though where an Agreément is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen Baron and Feme before Marriage, that the Wife may by Will dispose of part of her Estate, or for a thing which is future to the Marriage, such an Agreément is not dissolved by the Marriage; yet where an Agréement is to have Execution during the Coverture, as in the principal Case, there the Marriage extinguisheth such an Agréement. And the whole Court concluded the Plaintiff had no ground for Relief, and declared she had no Cause of Suit but by way of anticipation; for the Executors did not claim the Goods, but she feared the other Defendant the Infant, for whom they were Executors in Trust, would claim the Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the Court declared, that they would far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consider of the matter, and the Cause hath not yet received any farther Hearing.</p>

               <head type="sub">On a Demurrer.</head>
               <p>THE Bill was, A Bill of Review to reverse a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made about twenty years since, wherein the Mortgagor being Plaintiff against the Mortgagee to have a Redemption, it was decreed accordingly, paying the Mony to be found due on Account; and for that purpose referred to a Master to take the Account. And it was also decreed, that if the Plaintiff failed to pay the Mony at a day to be set by the Master, the Defendant should hold discharged of all Equity of Redemption.</p>
               <p>Pending the Reference the Suit abated by the death of one of the Parties Defendant, yet the Account went on without any notice taken to the Court of the Abatement; that the Executor being a Defendant to the Original Bill, the Master was attended on the behalf of both sides, and made up his Report, and that confirmed and decreed, and that Decree inrolled near twenty years since. And now the Plaintiff being Devisee of the Mortgagor, by Bill of Review assigns these Errors, and now excepts against the Decree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For that in respect of the Abatement, there was no Cause in Court when the Account was stated, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree drawn up and inrolled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> That it was Error for the Court to make a Decree for the Defendant to hold free of Equity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption on the Plaintiffs Bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decreed and inrolled, no Error or cause of Reversal.</note>The Demurrer was <hi>in nullo Erratum,</hi> and the Plaintiff not intituled to a Bill of Review.</p>
               <p>To the first it was answered it was only an Exception in point of Form, and not in point of Right; and that the Account being stated and settled ought not after such length of time to be let lose or ravelled into; and as to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42102:66"/>this Point cited the Case of the Lady <hi>Cranbourn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dalmahoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the second it was said that Circuity of Action is to be avoided, and that there were many Presidents of Decrees in this manner for the Defendant, and that what was decreed for the Defendant was most just, and could not be denied upon the account of Iustice.</p>
               <p>And the Court declared, they saw no cause to alter the Decree; and so allowed the Demurrer and dismist the Bill.</p>
               <p>After a Complaint of this in the Lords House, the matter of the Demurrer was reheard the ninth of <hi>March 1670.</hi> by the Lord Keeper, Chief Iustice <hi>Hale</hi> and <hi>Vaughan.</hi> And on long debate they seemed to incline against the Plaintiff; but took time to consider. And after <hi>21 July 1671.</hi> they all three delivered one uniform Opinion clearly,<note place="margin">A Devisee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain a Bill of Review because he is not in privity.</note> That the Plaintiff being Devisee is not intituled to a Bill of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, being not in privity to the Testator, against whom the Decree was; as if a Iudgment be against Land, and the Owner aliens the Land, the Alienee cannot bring a Writ of Error, nor the Vendor; and so dismist the Bill for this reason principally. Yet the Keéper and Chief Iustice <hi>Hale</hi> were of Opinion that the Error assigned was no sufficient Error to avoid the former Decree; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Abatement the Account ought to conclude and stand as an Account stated.</p>

               <head type="sub">On a Demurrer.</head>
               <p>THE Bill was to be relieved against an Action of Debt for Mony due to the Defendant as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, from the Plaintiff, for Wares sold in <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Equity was, That in the time of Hostility between that Crown and this, the Defendant being a Subject to this Crown,<note place="margin">Where Articles of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 2 Crowns can discharge a Subjects Debt.</note> the Plaintiff was forced to pay the Mony he owed the Defendant to Commissioners authorized in that behalf to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and that by the Articles of Peace between the two Crowns, it was agreéd, That all Monies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42102:67"/>so exacted from each others Subjects should be compensated by setting one against the other, and that the Parties that paid the Mony to either of the Kings Orders should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged against the Creditor.</p>
               <p>To this Bill the Defendant demurred, and insisted there was no Equity, and that if the Articles did bind private Persons, they were as good at Law as here; but at Law they did not bind, for the Defendant had a Verdict.</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff <hi>Marah's</hi> Mother was Sister of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Grice,</hi> and by Articles of Agreement made between <hi>Thomas More</hi> the Plaintiffs Father and <hi>Nicholas Grice</hi> the Defendant (in behalf of his Sister the Plaintiffs Mother,) it was agreéed, That in consideration of <hi>800 l.</hi> agreed to be given with the Plaintiffs Mother in Portion to the Plaintiffs Father (whereof <hi>600 l.</hi> was <hi>Nicholas's</hi> own free Gift,) That the said <hi>Nicholas</hi> should stand seised in trust of the Lands in question, as a Iointure, for the proper use of the Plaintiffs Mother for and during her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life, the Remainder to the Issue of her Body (which the Plaintiff only is) the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>Thomas More.</hi> These Lands were in truth mortgaged by <hi>More</hi> before, and the Defendant did pay him <hi>500 l.</hi> of the Portion, and was wrought upon by him to deliver up the Articles, and for <hi>5 l.</hi> to release to <hi>More</hi> the Lands, and <hi>More</hi> and his Wife had by Deed and Fine sold the Lands away; and so to be relieved against the Breach of Trust was the intent of the Bill.</p>
               <p>And for the Plaintiff it was insisted, that the Defendant ought to make good to the Plaintiff the value of the Lands ever since her Mothers death, who died about <hi>20</hi> years since, and the full value of the Lands, if to be sold (by the Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lands being to come to her immediately after her Mothers death.)</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42102:67"/>
               <p> But for the Defendant it was insisted, That if there were a Breach of Trust, it was no ill intent in him, nor any thing to his benefit, but to comply with the necessity of the Plaintiffs Father (who is still living,) and if a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been made according to the Articles, it might have beén so awarded, that he and his Wife might have prevented the Estate from coming to the Plaintiff. And they did after sell the Lands by a Fine; and however the Plaintiffs Father, according to the true meaning of the Articles, was to have had at least an Estate for Life in the Lands: For it was absurd to think, that the Husband in Marriage should settle his Lands on his Wife and her Issue, and exclude himself for life; and being mentioned in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that the Wife should have them for a Iointure,<note place="margin">The word <hi>(Jointure)</hi> in an Agreement, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the Husband shall have an Estate for Life as well as the Wife.</note> and after to her Issue, The very word <hi>Jointure</hi> did imply that the Husband should have an Estate for his life as well as the Wife, and that was the usual way of settling Iointures for life on the Husband, and then in Remainder to the Wife for life. And it was said, That if a Bill had been brought against <hi>More</hi> to compel him to make a Settlement according to the Articles, the Court would never have excluded him of an Estate for his own life. And of this Opinion the Lord Keeper declared he was as to the Husbands Estate for life, and that he ought to have the Premises by intention of Agreement for life. And therefore, and inasmuch as <hi>600 l.</hi> of this Portion was agreéd to be given by the Defendant as a free Gift of his own, and it was uncertain what the value of the Lands might be after the Plaintiffs Fathers death, and there was <hi>300 l.</hi> of the <hi>800 l.</hi> unpaid, the Lord Keéper proposed, that the Plaintiff should have the said <hi>300 l.</hi> with Damages, and the Defendant to pay it her accordingly. And so it was decreed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>TAnfield Vachel</hi> by his last Will in Writing deviseth to the effect following, <hi>(viz.) I give the Use of all my several Paintings and Books of Print, my coloured Collection of Medals in Gold, Silver and Brass, all my rare Turnings of Ivory and Guyacomb, with my Press of Books and Chest of Drawers with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective in it, to my dearly beloved Wife (being the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Rebecca Vachel</hi>) during the Term of her natural Life: And my Will is, That if she be with Child of a Son, that then after her decease the same Paintings, Books of Print, &amp;c. shall be left, remain and come to the same Son; But if my Wife be not with Child of a Son, or if the same Son shall die without Issue Male of his Body, then my Will is, That all the said Paintings, Books of Print, &amp;c. after the decease of my said Wife, and the death of such

               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff replyed, that <hi>Brown</hi> was his Solicitor in the other Cause, and that he answered by his advice, and that he advised it was fit to answer to them, and for that purpose advised the now Plaintiff, before he put in that Answer, to enter into a Bond to <hi>Brown</hi> for more Mony that so he might swear as he did in that Answer, which Bond he promised <hi>Smith</hi> to deliver back when he had put in his Answer,<note place="margin">A Trust decreed for a person who in his Answer on Oath in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cause had denyed the Trust because drawn in to answer so by Fraud.</note> and did so, and averred he was at the whole Charge in defending the Suit, and that <hi>Brown</hi> after that Answer owned the Trust in that Bond of <hi>23 l.</hi> for the Plaintiff, and there was proof of that.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THIS Cause was heard first before the Lord Keéper. The Case. The Plaintiff <hi>Margaret</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Ann</hi> were the two Daughters of <hi>Smith,</hi> who having made his Will eighteen years since, and <hi>Hill</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and Curator of the Children (both then in Infancy) by his Will gave several Legacies, and then gave the residue of his personal Estate to be equally divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweén his two Daughters, <hi>Ann</hi> and <hi>Margaret;</hi> and if both die before Marriage or full age, then he deviseth it over to another. <hi>Biscoe</hi> marrieth <hi>Ann</hi> the eldest Sister, and then one Moiety of the Estate, which was good, and in the hands of the Executor, is paid to <hi>Biscoe</hi> and his Wife, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42102:73"/>
                  <hi>Biscoe</hi> settles a Ioynture for this on his Wife, and gives the Executor a discharge.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Executor puts out the other Moiety (<hi>Margaret</hi> being still in Minority) on Security, and part of it is lost. Then <hi>Margaret</hi> marries <hi>Nelthrop,</hi> and they bring this Bill against the Executor, and <hi>Biscoe</hi> and his Wife to have a Contribution towards the loss born by them, and to have <hi>Biscoe</hi> refund.</p>
               <p>Vpon the first hearing it was so decréed unless <hi>Biscoe</hi> shewed Presidents to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now upon farther hearing this day <hi>(viz.) 10 Jan. 1669.</hi> before the Lord Kéeper, Mr. Iustice <hi>Wild,</hi> and Mr. Baron <hi>Turner,</hi> It was for <hi>Biscoe</hi> insisted, That by the Marriage of <hi>Ann,</hi> her moiety became due, and the Devise over is defeated; so that if <hi>Biscoe</hi> and his Wife had brought their Bill for it, the Executor could not have denyed payment of it, and so <hi>Biscoe</hi> hath done no fault, who hath not his Mony till due, and he is not concerned to look any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in lieu of the Portion a Ioynture is made, and a Release for the Legacy is given; and probably if the Executor would not have paid, <hi>Ann</hi> might have lost her preferment, and the Executor was by the Will the Curator of the Children. And it was said, that by <hi>Anns</hi> Marriage first she became first intituled. And it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted that where Legacies are payable at several times, and the Legacy that is first due is paid when due, and there is Mony in the Executors hands to pay the other Legacies, that if a loss fall on that afterwards, there is Equity in that Case to put the first paid Legatée to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fund.</p>
               <p>For the Plaintiff it was insisted, That there was in this Case no time limited for payment of either; and that by the Marriage of <hi>Ann</hi> the Devise over being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, both became due and payable, the Devise being indefinite without any express time of payment: And the Plaintiff <hi>Margarets</hi> Infancy ought not to turn to her Prejudice; and that it was the Testators intention that they should have it equally, one as much as the other. And if <hi>Biscoe</hi> had sued, the Executor might have required Security to refund.</p>
               <p>And it was said and admitted by the Court, That if Executors pay out the Assets in Legacies,<note place="margin">Where a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee shall refund for want of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets.</note> and afterwards Debts appear, and they be forced to pay them, of which they had no notice before the Legacies paid, That
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42102:73"/>the Executors by a Bill here might force the Legateés to refund.</p>
               <p>But as to that it was answered, That Case was not like to this; for there was not enough to pay all when the Legacies were paid: But here was enough when the Legacies were paid, to pay all, and the loss since.</p>
               <p>And for the Plaintiff it was farther insisted, That a division could not be made without the Plaintiff <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> called to it; and the Case of <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Banson</hi> insisted on, where <hi>Banson</hi> had a Conveyance and Statute for his Wifes Legacy, and yet put to refund.</p>
               <p>But as to that Case it was answered, There was not any Payment, but a Security, and by that he would have had a Redemption; so this payment was not paid, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Picks</hi> against <hi>Vincner</hi> 29 <hi>Oct.</hi> 1639.</note> And the Plaintiff cited the Case of <hi>Picks</hi> and <hi>Vincner</hi> upon Sir <hi>Henry Martins</hi> Certificate, which was the 29th of <hi>October, 1639.</hi> and was in substance thus, That an Executor may not pay one if he hath not enough to pay all.

               <p>Ordered the Cause be set down to be re-heard origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as well against the Executor as the Legatee <hi>Biscoe</hi> and his Wife.</p>

                  <hi>MOuntjoy</hi> Earl of <hi>Newport</hi> had two Daughters, <hi>Isabella,</hi> who by his consent married <hi>Nicholas</hi> Earl of <hi>Banbury</hi> (whose Daughter the Plaintiff the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> is,) and <hi>Ann,</hi> who without her Fathers consent married <hi>Thomas Porter</hi> Esquire, by whom she had <hi>George</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant the Infant.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Newport</hi> being seized of <hi>Newport-House</hi> in Fée, by his Will in Writing deviseth in these Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item, <hi>I give and bequeath unto the Lady</hi> Ann <hi>Countess of</hi> Newport, <hi>my dear Wife, all that my House called</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port-House, <hi>and all other my Tenements in the County of</hi> Middlesex, <hi>for her Life, and from and after the death of my said Wife, I do give my said House and all other my Tenements in</hi> Middlesex <hi>unto my Grandchild the Lady</hi> Ann Knowls, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Nicholas <hi>Earl of</hi> Banbury, <hi>by the Lady</hi> Isabella, <hi>my late Daughter, and the Heirs of her Body to be begotten. Provided always and upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That my said Grandchild the Lady</hi> Ann Knowls <hi>do marry with the Consent of my said Wife, and of</hi> Charles <hi>Earl of</hi> Warwick, <hi>and of</hi> Edward <hi>Earl of</hi> Manchester, <hi>or the major part of them. And in case the Lady</hi> Ann Knowls <hi>do and shall marry without the Consent of my said Wife, or the major part of my Trustees aforesaid, or shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to depart this Life without any Issue of her Body, then I will and bequeath all my said Premisses unto my Grandchild</hi> George Porter, <hi>Son of my deceased Daughter, the Lady</hi> Ann, <hi>late Wife of</hi> Thomas Porter <hi>Esquire, and to his Heirs for ever.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff <hi>Fry</hi> after the death of the Lord <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> stole away the Plaintiff, the Lady <hi>Ann,</hi> in the night from <hi>Newport-House</hi> (where she lived with her Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) over the Garden Wall, and so soon as she was
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42102:74"/>mist by her Grandmother, and she was informed of this fact, she sent to the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Manchester</hi> to inform them of it, who both protested against the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as unfitting for the young Lady, who was at that time about fourteen years of age, and declared their utter dislike of it. Afterwards these two Earls being examined for the Plaintiffs as Witnesses in the Cause, say, That they do assent to the Marriage, and that they do not know but that if their Consents had been asked for before the Marriage, such reason might have been given as they might have consented to it. And they and other Witnesses speak as to the Earl of <hi>Newports</hi> intent and frequent Declarations, that the Plaintiff the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> should have <hi>Newport-House,</hi> which the Plaintiffs Counsel would lay weight upon to interpret the meaning of the Will to be <hi>in terrorem</hi> only, and not to defeat the Devise to the Lady <hi>Ann.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bill was to be relieved against the Condition and the Breach of it.</p>
               <p>And for the Plaintiffs on the first Hearing, which was before the Master of the <hi>Rolls</hi> only (in the Lord Kéepers absence) It was insisted on by Serjeant <hi>Fountain,</hi> that there were three things in Equity upon which the Plaintiff ought to be relieved against this penalty.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1st.</hi> That there was no other reason for this Condition and Penalty but to prevent the Ladys Marriage without Consent, and therefore it was to be expounded <hi>in terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi> only.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> That this young Lady was but fourtéen years old, and knew nothing before her Marriage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> As she was in her Infancy and knew nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Marriage of the Condition, so soon after as she did know it, she did go to the two Earls (her Grandmother being dead) and they did approve of the Marriage.</p>
               <p>For the Defendant it was insisted, that the Infancy or want of notice to her of the Condition was of no weight, for that there was not by the Will any Provision made or any directions given to give her notice, but as she takes by the Will as a Purchaser, so she must take it subject to such Condition as the Will hath subjected it to, and is to take notice at her peril, and an Infant may break a Condition; and this act of hers in marrying was but what the Earl had reason to expect she would do before
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42102:75"/>she came to the Age of one and twenty years, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing usual for Ladies of her Quality to stay till one and twenty before they marry. And as to the pretence that this Condition was <hi>in terrorem,</hi> It was said, That it was a Limitation, and that it was by the Will limited over to the Defendant in case of the Lady <hi>Anns</hi> Marriage without Consent, <hi>pari passu</hi> to her dying without Issue. And though the Civil Law may construe the Limitation in a personalty over in such Cases as this to be void and to be but <hi>in terrorem,</hi> yet in this Court in the Case of Inheritances, as this is, nay even in the Case of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonalty where it was limited over as here, this Court hath not at any time avoyded such Limitation over;<note place="margin">Where the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy on Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Legatee marry with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Equity, notwithstanding the breach of the Condition, and where not.</note> The constant difference taken in this Court being betwixt a Condition to make the Devise void without limiting it over to another, and the limiting it over to another: In the first of which Cases the Court hath usually construed the Condition to be <hi>in terrorem</hi> only, because there is no other person appointed to take, as in the Case of Sir <hi>Henry Bellasis</hi> now cited (which you may sée before <hi>fol. 22.</hi>) But where it hath been limited over it hath béen always taken otherwise; As in the Case of <hi>Davis</hi> against <hi>Halton, November 1664.</hi> the matter here being <hi>1000 l.</hi> part of what was given to the party who broke the Condition; and so though it were for a personalty, the Limitation over is good.</p>
               <p>The Master of the <hi>Rolls.</hi> There is no difference in this Case whether it be a Condition or a Limitation, for the Penalty is the same in both: And this must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be <hi>in terrorem;</hi> and the Infant had no notice of the Condition, and so decréed against the Defendant. And that the Plaintiff, the Lady and the Heirs of her Body should hold and enjoy against him.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Appeal. Lord Keeper. Chief Justice <hi>Keeling.</hi> Chief Justice <hi>Vaughan.</hi> Chief Baron <hi>Hales.</hi>
                  </note>The Defendant appealed from this Order by a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prayed the Entry thereof might be stayed, and it was so, and ordered to be re-heard by the Lord Kéeper, assisted with the Lord Chief Iustice <hi>Keeling,</hi> Chief Iustice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and Chief Baron <hi>Hales, 22 April, 1670.</hi> At which Hearing it was insisted by Serjeant <hi>Fountain</hi> for the Plaintiff that this was a Penalty <hi>in terrorem</hi> that the Daughter might not rashly marry, but she was then an Infant without notice of it, and the Earls do approve the Marriage.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42102:75"/>
               <p> Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Defendant. Its a Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not a Condition: A Will would not pass Lands by the Common Law; its by the Statute, and that says the Will shall stand. And for Notice, the Law requires no Notice to be given, nor did the Earl the Devisor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any: And who should give Notice? The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is an Infant, and could we give notice? <hi>Mente Testatum ratum est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Subsequent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent will not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of Consent prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note>Mr. Solicitor <hi>Finch</hi> for the Defendant. There can be no Decrée, for the subsequent approbation works nothing, and was extorted by Compulsion. For when the Earls were first acquainted with the Marriage, they disallowed it, and the Estate divested out of the Lady by the Marriage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Consent, and the subsequent Assent cannot revest it. The primary intention was <hi>in terrorem</hi> to restrain the Lady from an imprudent disposal of her self; but the secondary Intention was, that if she did marry without Consent, she should lose the Lands. The Grandfather could not have settled it stronger than he hath. And that the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father may impose such Condition on his Children is not to be denyed. And if this Court should relieve against it, it is to incourage disobedience in Children to Parents. And this is a Case purely at Law, and the matter of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and other Circumstances are all to be considered at Law as well as here, and if not relievable there, its the same here. And if Notice is necessary, as I conceive it is not, that is purely at Law, and possibly it may be found at one Tryal, that there was not Notice, and at another it may be found there was Notice; and it being matter of Inheritance and Freehold, the Defendant ought to be at liberty to try it <hi>toties quoties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Condition may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in all circumstances and yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved here.</note>Serjeant <hi>Fountain.</hi> A Limitation may be at Law, and yet relievable here: As if the Condition be to have the Consent in writing, and the Consent is had without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, this Court will help in that Case. And he doubted whether a Father can so provide or limit an Estate, as that a Court of Equity shall have no power over it, for it cannot be so provided by agréement of Parties in Case of a Mortgage, that this Court shall not give Relief;<note place="margin">Agreement of Parties cannot prevent a Court of Equity in its Jurisdiction.</note> and Equity is part of the Law of <hi>England:</hi> And there are Emergencies and Cases which a Man cannot provide for; as suppose the Plaintiffs had sent to the Parties for their Consent, and the Messenger never went, but said he did, and had their Consent, and upon this she had married, she
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42102:76"/>should certainly be helpt in Equity.<note place="margin">Equity regards the Substance and not the Ceremony.</note> And the end of the Will is performed, she was to marry such person as the Earls should like of, and they have approved, and so the substance is performed; and whether it be a Limitation or Condition is equally penal; and a Limitation over of personal Legacies is void by the Civil Law, I grant; but that in some Cases of a Limitation over there may be Equity it clearly follows in this upon the circumstances of Infancy, and not Notice and Assent subsequent.</p>
               <p>The Court would see Presidents. And then <hi>30 May 1670.</hi> upon perusal of all the Presidents, the whole Court agréed in one uniform Opinion to dismiss the Bill, and accordingly it was dismist.</p>
               <p>Chief Baron <hi>Hales</hi> argued thus:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>

                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Whether any Relief be to be given against it.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> Whether upon the Circumstances it is relievable here.</item>

               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1st.</hi> He conceived it a Limitation and Condition both in Law and Equity, because its collateral to the Land; she may marry if she will, but if without Consent, there is a Penalty.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Its a Condition, because it is to contain the Party in that due Obedience which Law and Nature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her; and she should have applyed to her Grandmother for her Consent, though there had béen no such Condition. And although in the Civil Law in the Case of a meer personalty, the Limitation over be void, yet this is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise of the Lands not governed by that Law.<note place="margin">Estates govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Common Law ought not to be influenced by another Law.</note> Estates governable by the Law of this Kingdom without relation to another form ought not to be influenced by another Law, and this being a good Condition, it cannot be in Law defeated, and there being a full breach of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as Law will not, Equity cannot help. And as to the Objection if there may not be Relief against breach of Conditions in Equity, there will be a great shatter in Decrées already made; this Case is not like the Case of a Mortgage, where the Condition is for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mony; because there if the mony be not paid at the day there, may be a compensation made by payment at another day with Damages.</item>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42102:76"/>
                  <item>
                     <note place="margin">The Breach of a Condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary disposition, not relievable in Equity.</note>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> Again, this Breach is not relievable in Equity, because it is a voluntary disposition throughout, both <hi>in equali gradu</hi> as to the Settlement and as to the blood of him that made the Settlement. And it appears by the Will of the Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> that made the Settlement, that he did as really intend it should go over for marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Consent, as the Ladys dying without Issue. And he rests much on it that there is no President of any Relief given in this Case;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tamen quiaere</hi> the two Cases of <hi>Peyton</hi> and <hi>Shipdam,</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> and <hi>Tookey</hi> here cited, for Presidents are otherwise.</note> for upon view of all the Presidents he doth not think any of them come to this Case; and its not fit to go further than the Court hath gone already, for if they should, there would be no end, and its fit to set bounds. And as to what was offered from the Proof, that it was the Earls Intention that the Lady should have <hi>Newport-House,</hi> and that therefore it was <hi>in terrorem;</hi> He said that no collateral Averment to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Will ought to be admitted, for if there should, there would be no certainty in any Case. And as to the Earls approving the Marriage since, he said they were charitable therein; and though Equity will favour Infants, yet an Infant may be bound by Law to a performance of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and inasmuch as this Condition is annexed to an Act (Marriage) which she as an Infant might do,<note place="margin">Whether Notice be necessary to be given of a Condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to whom the Estate is given.</note> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy will not help. And as to the point of Notice, I will not determine here, whether Notice be requisite and necessary, for that is at Law, and want of it, if necessary, will avail there. I will not say what Equity may do in case of want of Notice, but that Fact is not settled whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notice or no: It would be hard, because there is not full Notice proved, to conclude here is no Notice, and so would have the Bill dismist.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Keeling</hi> agréed, and said, 'Tis fit to kéep those Bonds which Parents impose to hold their Children at Obedience, streight, and not fit for a Court of Equity to relax them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vaughan.</hi> As to the Consent subsequent, that signifies nothing, for a Man cannot be said to consent to a thing which is not capable of Consent, as to say, a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents that his Heir is of such a colour is nonsense, for that is not an object of his Consent, and after the Marriage their Consents signifie no more in that Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord Keeper</hi> declared he was clear of Opinion, That Equity ought not to interpose in this Case, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42102:77"/>was glad to see that a Parent could settle his Estate, that it might be out of a power of a Court of Equity, and so the Bill was dismist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That upon Tryal and an Argument after this Hearing in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> It was adjudged that Notice was not necessary to be given.</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff was eldest Son by a second Venter, and the Defendant was eldest Son and Heir by the first Venter; and the Bill was to be relieved for a Rent-Charge of <hi>200 l. per annum</hi> of which there was half a year due.</p>
               <p>The Bill did suggest, that the Defendant kept not any Stock upon the Ground, but converted it all to Tillage, so that the Plaintiff had not a sufficient distress, and so was without Remedy save in Equity, and prayed a Decrée against the Defendant for the Arrears and growing Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Defendant demurred for that the Lands only being charged with the Rent at Law, there was no Equity to charge the Defendants person.</p>
               <p>But this Demurrer was over-ruled, it being laid in the Bill that there was a legal defect in the assurance, which ought to be made good in Equity, the Grant being on a good consideration.</p>
               <p>The Defendant answered, and denyed the converting the Premisses always to Tillage, or that the same were not overt to a distress; but said there had béen divers times a Stock worth <hi>250 l.</hi> upon them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon and upon reading the Proofs in the Cause, the Court declared, they would be attended with Presidents, where Cases of this nature had béen relieved, and then would give their Opinion. <hi>8 Novemb. 1668.</hi> The Court ordered the Cause to be set down again on the Presidents, which the Plaintiff were to deliver to the Defendant.<note place="margin">Bowman <hi>or</hi> Boreman <hi>against</hi> Yate.</note> One President was this, <hi>Seymore Boreman</hi> and <hi>Francis Yeat</hi> Plaintiffs against <hi>John Yeat</hi> Esquire Defendant.

To have that done, and to discover the Buttals and Boundaries, and to have the Rents arrear and growing Rents paid, was the scope of the Bill.</p>
               <p>The Defendant by answer insisted, That the Plaintiffs proper Remedy was at Law, and that <hi>Boreman</hi> had not a good Title, because he had not any Attornment, for ought appeared, or any good Conveyance from <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and justified the detainer of the Deéds.</p>
               <p>On the first Hearing <hi>25 Jan. 12 Car. 2.</hi> Ordered a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to go to set out the Lands, and <hi>Boreman's</hi> Title to be determined on the return of the Commission.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42102:78"/>the Rents reserved and Lands out of which the Rents and Profits are issuing at the highest yearly Value, not exceéding <hi>300 l. per annum,</hi> after the Leases expire, should be lyable to the payment of those Rents to the Plaintiff <hi>Boreman</hi> during <hi>Elizabeths</hi> life, and after <hi>300 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> to the Plaintiff <hi>Francis,</hi> according to the true meaning of the Deed.</p>
               <p>The difference betwixt the two Cases was,</p>
               <p>First, In the principal Case the Rent was well limited to the Plaintiff in point of Law by the name of the first Son of the second Venter, and he may distrain, and having Seisin, may bring an Assize. But in <hi>Boreman's</hi> Case nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himself had any Remedy at Law for want of Attounrment, and by reason of intermixture with other Lands, nor had the other Plaintiff, by reason he was not Heir male to his Father; but that Defendant was by a former Venter, so the Limitation not good in Law. And observe in <hi>Bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Case the Lands only are made lyable, not the person.</p>
               <p>Another President delivered by the Plaintiff to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, was <hi>22 June, 1644. Elizabeth Ferris</hi> against <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> where an Annuity being devised by Will, and by the same Will the same Lands devised to an half Brother of the Devisée of the Annuity, this being a Rent Seck without Seizen and no power of distress, and the Devisée of the Lands having promised to pay it; The Court did decrée the Deviseé of the Lands to give Seisin of the Rent to the Devisee of the Annuity,<note place="margin">Seisin decreed of a Rent Seck.</note> which Case, as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was against the Plaintiff in the principal Case, it being in his power to have Seisin when he would. And the Court in this Case did not decrée the Lands to be liable.</p>
               <p>And now upon the further hearing of the principal Case, the Plaintiffs Counsel did not think fit to insist upon, or so much as to mention their Presidents, but stood only upon the defect of a distress, and that the arrears of the <hi>200 l. per annum,</hi> were now <hi>100 l.</hi> and the Land but <hi>200 l. per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> declared on the Debate of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Case, that unless there did appear a fraud to hinder the Plaintiff of his distress, he could not have Relief here. And that all he could do, was to refer it to a Tryal at Law,<note place="margin">Fraud to hinder a Distress, where tried.</note> whether there was any Fraud to hinder the Plaintiff of his distress; and accordingly at the Plaintiffs desire did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to a Tryal.</p>

               <p>To this Bill it was demurred in <hi>Bennet</hi> and <hi>Boxes</hi> Case; and on debate the Lord Kéeper inclined to think it all one with that Case.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Bill was an Original Bill to set aside a Decreé in <hi>1664.</hi> obtained by the Defendant on a Bill of Reviver (to which the now Plaintiff is no Party) against <hi>John Style,</hi> Heir of Sir <hi>Humphrey Style,</hi> and others, as obtained by Fraud. The Case was thus;</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Humphry Styles's</hi> Lady (Mother of the said <hi>Richard Bosvile</hi>) had by his request mortgaged a Mannor of hers for <hi>3000 l.</hi> borrowed by Sir <hi>Humphry 8 Nov. 8 Car. 1.</hi> And Sir <hi>Humphry</hi> had agreed with his Lady, That if he did not pay off that <hi>3000 l.</hi> that then his Lands in <hi>Kent</hi> should stand obliged to pay <hi>1500 l.</hi> of the <hi>3000 l.</hi> for the ease and benefit of the said Lady and her Heirs. And <hi>15 Novemb. 8 Car. 1.</hi> he conveyed his Kentish Lands to Trusteés, which the Defendants say was for that purpose, but no such express Trust. <hi>Trin. 1641.</hi> The Lady <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> being dead, <hi>Richard Bosvile</hi> her Son and Heir exhibited his Bill against Sir <hi>Humphry</hi> and the Trustees in the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Lands to have the benefit of this Agreement. And in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42102:80"/>
                  <hi>Trin. 1642.</hi> two Witnesses were examined to the proof of the Agreement against Sir <hi>Humphry Style,</hi> and that the conveyance of the Kentish Lands was on that Trust. The Wars coming on there was a rest, and no farther Proceédings till <hi>1663.</hi> In <hi>1665. Richard Bosvile,</hi> who was a Recusant, died, his Heir then, and yet an Infant. <hi>Michaelmas 1663. Martin &amp; Ux'</hi> and the other Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, the Infant, brought a Bill of Reviver against <hi>John Style,</hi> the Heir of Sir <hi>Humphry,</hi> and the Heir of the surviving Trusteé. And in <hi>1664.</hi> after the Answer of <hi>John Style,</hi> who by Answer said he was willing the Plaintiffs in the Bill of Reviver may have their Mony, if he may have the rest of the Lands, and Replication and farther proof taken and published, it was decreed, That the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs in the Bill of Reviver should hold the Lands against <hi>John Style</hi> and his Heirs, and all claiming under Sir <hi>Humphry Style</hi> since the first Bill, until the <hi>1500 l.</hi> with Costs and Interest were paid off, of which Bill of Reviver the now Plaintiff had due notice given him, and he might, if he had pleased, come in by a Cross Bill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Decree. The now Plaintiff made Title by an Intail of Sir <hi>Humphry Style</hi> on him in <hi>1638.</hi> precedent to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bill, so that Title was not bound by the Decreé. But that Settlement being in truth revoked in <hi>1643.</hi> he made another Title by the Will of Sir <hi>Humphry Style</hi> in <hi>1658.</hi> And for the now Plaintiff it was insisted, that there was a Collusion in getting the Decree, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>John Style</hi> admitting it by Answer to it on the matter, and the now Plaintiff, who was Ter-tenant, no Party to it: And the Report of the Master who had computed the <hi>1500 l.</hi> and Interest to amount to <hi>3600 l.</hi> was confirmed without any defence by <hi>John Style.</hi> And the Rule for bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Titles <hi>pendente lite</hi> (which is the Rule of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice this day) was the Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Rule, and that Rule is, That <hi>lis pendens</hi> binds, if it be in full Prosecution; but here was above twenty years cessation, and the Plaintiff had in that time bought in Incumbrances, and improved the Lands, and the notice given the Plaintiff of the Bill of Reviver was too late, Issue being joined so that he could not come in. And its said, where Iudgment is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against the Land, and the Ter-tenant is no Party, a Writ of Deceit lies for the Ter-tenant, and so in a parity of reason this Bill was maintainable for the now Complainant. <hi>Spencers</hi> Case <hi>5th</hi> Report was cited. And
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42102:81"/>it was farther said for the Plaintiff, That there was no such Agreement between Sir <hi>Humphry Style</hi> and his Lady as the Decree was grounded upon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Smiths</hi> Case was to be relieved against an Act done by the Lunatick in assigning a Debt, because he was a Lunatick at that time; so that if he had been a Party, it had been to stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himself, which the Law does not admit. <hi>Vide Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys</hi> Case <hi>4</hi> Report, and <hi>quaere</hi> how it can be done by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on his behalf.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Beverleys</hi> Case the King hath the custody of his Person, of his Lands and his Goods so as to provide for the Ideot to prevent an Alienation; and therefore by <hi>Scire facias</hi> may avoid a Feoffment and other disposition made by the Ideot.

                  <hi>tamen quaere.</hi> And upon that ground I suppose it was those Bills were grounded; for it was declared by the Court, that those Bills were proper to be brought by the Attorny. And in <hi>Woolrich's</hi> Case the Bill was to be relieved upon a

               <p> On the first hearing of this Demurrer the Court gave time to search for Presidents, where after a Cause heard upon the Merits, and dismist in the Exchequer, a new Bill had beén admitted here:<note place="margin">Dismission of a Cause without prejudice in Law or Equity how to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</note> And none being to be found, now upon farther hearing of the Demurrer, it was for the Plaintiff insisted, that this was a special dismission, it being without prejudice either in Law or Equity, which words must be considered to signifie something; but they did not signifie any thing, unless it were meant the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission should not hinder the Plaintiff from seeking his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in any other Court of Law or Equity. And so the Court did conceive,<note place="margin">Matters former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined to in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, may be new examined in Chancery.</note> and ordered that the Plaintiff might er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine any Witnesses that were not examined in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and that as to the Matters examined unto there, the Plaintiff might examine the same Witnesses <hi>de bene esse,</hi> and how far those <hi>de bene esse</hi> should be used, the Court would farther consider.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Case of Sir <hi>Thomas Badd</hi> was, That he was Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to <hi>Edward Dennis</hi> (whose Sister and Heir the Plaintiff is) and at fifteen years of Age married him to the Defendant <hi>Frances</hi> his Daughter. Sir <hi>Robert Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> had a Mortgage of <hi>200 l.</hi> of part of the Infants Estate, which Mortgage Sir <hi>Thomas Badd</hi> paid off, and took the same assigned to other Persons. The Infant after at seventeen years of Age made his Will, and the Defendant <hi>Frances</hi> his Wife Executrix. The Bill was, That tho Sir <hi>Thomas Badd</hi> had paid off the Mortgage with the Infants own Mony, yet he now pretends it was not for the benefit of the Infant, but that he paid it with his own Mony, and for what Mony he had of the Infants he was accountable to his own Daughter the Executrix, and so would leave the whole Mortgage-Mony still on the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage-Lands, which belong to the Plaintiff as Sister and Heir to the Infant.</p>

               <p> The Defendant Sir <hi>Thomas Badd</hi> by answer said, That the Mony he had paid Sir <hi>Robert Dillington</hi> was his own Mony, and that he had not near enough of the Infants to pay the same, and that if he had had enough of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Mony, yet he could not justifie the disposing of it.</p>

               <p>And in this Case the Master of the Rolls declared, That Sir <hi>Thomas Badd</hi> ought to imploy what he had of the Estate of the Infant, as far as it would go, to pay his Debts, and did Decree a Redemption of the Mortgage, and that Sir <hi>Thomas Badd</hi> should account; and that what he had of the Infants in his Hands, when the Mortgage was paid off, should be applied in discount of Mortgage-Mony, and upon payment of what more was due the Plaintiff to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem.</p>

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:42102:84"/>the Devise is ineffectual, and so raiseth Cavils to defeat the Charity, and so has got the possession of the Lands and Goods, and refuseth to let the Master and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows have them, that if by the Statute of <hi>Mortmain</hi> the said Charity be avoidable, yet by other Laws for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Charitable Vses, and according to Equity, the Charitable Vse ought to be made good.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42102:85"/>made to commence after the death of <hi>Martha, (Thomas</hi> his Wife) for life or lives only of such Child or Children, and for their Preferment: <hi>Thomas</hi> having no other way to provide for his Daughters younger Children, <hi>5 May 1657.</hi> for love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to them, and for provision of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them, grants, bargains and sells the Lands in question to the Defendant <hi>Vyler, Habendum</hi> to him and his Assigns for the Lives of the Plaintiff <hi>Martha</hi> and her Sister, and for their only use and benefit, to remain from the death of <hi>Thomas Kendrick</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> his Wife.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiffs by their Bill suggest, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>Martha</hi> had no provision but this, and that her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did look upon it that he had well pursued his power in the Decree to <hi>Vylet,</hi> or else that he would have taken the Wood of the other Lands of greater value, which he knew were by the Settlement <hi>supra,</hi> to come to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and complained that the Defendant taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that the Power was not literally pursued, did stand upon it, whereas it was in substance pursued, and the Estate granted to <hi>Vylet</hi> was less than by the Power, <hi>Thomas</hi> had power to grant; for by the Power he was to grant to commence on the death of <hi>Martha</hi> his Wife only, and he made it to commence on the death of Himself and <hi>Martha,</hi> which was less than he had power to do; and the mistake did happen by reason that in the Settlement the Lands were limited to <hi>Thomas</hi> for life, the Remainder in Trust for a Iointure for <hi>Martha.</hi>

               <p>To which the Defendant <hi>Kendrick</hi> demurred, for that the Deed of Settlement, and Deed to <hi>Vylet</hi> was void in Law, and being defective in the execution of the Power, it ought not to be supplied in Equity. In the arguing of which Demurrer it was insisted, that both the Conveyances being voluntary, the case was the same here as at Law, and no reason to help here against Law at all. And it was said, That if such defects should be supplied in Equity, it would be in vain to imploy Men of skill in drawing Conveyances and Settlements, but every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Man might do it as well.

               <p>
                  <hi>Trin. 1669.</hi> The Plaintiffs by their Bill set forth, That the ninteéth of <hi>January 1662. Henry English</hi> by Indenture and Fine (wherein the Wife joined) conveyed to the Plaintiffs Sir <hi>Richard Chaworth</hi> and <hi>Henry Malory</hi> and their Heirs, the Mannor of <hi>Monfield</hi> in the County of <hi>Sussex,</hi> to the use of Mistris <hi>Duppa</hi> for five hundred years, as a Mortgage for the security of <hi>4000 l.</hi> payable the fourth of <hi>March 1664.</hi> with Interest in the mean time.

The <hi>7</hi> of <hi>December</hi> after the <hi>21</hi> of <hi>October 1665.</hi> (the Mortgages and Recognizances being forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Mistress <hi>Duppa</hi> died before payment, having made her Will, and the Plaintiffs her Executors, who proved the same. <hi>Trinity-Term 1667.</hi> the Plaintiffs having brought several Ejectments, exhibited their Bill here against Mr. <hi>English</hi> and his Wife. That Mr. <hi>English</hi> might discover Incumbrances, and redeem by a day, or that his Equity of Redemption might be barred. Whereto Mr. <hi>English</hi> and his Lady after they had stood in a contempt to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Rebellion, put in their Answer, but did not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42102:86"/>discover any Incumbrances. <hi>Michealmas-Term 1667</hi> Mr. <hi>English</hi> suffered Iudgment in Ejectment at the Plaintiffs Suit, with a <hi>Cesset executio</hi> till <hi>May</hi> after. <hi>18 May 1668</hi> the <hi>cesset executio</hi> being expired, Mr. <hi>English</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any Arguments the Plaintiffs Councel could make, obtained an Order of this Court for stay of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Proceedings at Law upon the Iudgment in Ejectment till hearing, and another Order. <hi>5 June 1668,</hi> The Cause coming to be heard, the Court decreed that Mr. <hi>English</hi> should pay what was due to the Plaintiffs in a twelve-month, or in default the Plaintiffs should enjoy the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises discharged of all Equity of Redemption against him, and all claiming under him. <hi>26 November 1668.</hi> The Master to whom it was referred to take the Account, reported <hi>8530 l. 14 s.</hi> payable to the Plaintiffs the sixth of <hi>June 1669. 5 February 1668</hi> the Report was decreed, and the Decree thereupon signed and inrolled.</p>
               <p>The Bill farther chargeth, That the Defendants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to elude the said Decree, and defeat the Plaintiffs of the Benefit thereof, and of their Iudgment in Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pretended that Mr. <hi>English</hi> had mortgaged to them in <hi>June 1665,</hi> in Feé the Manor of <hi>Wigsel</hi> for the security of <hi>2000 l.</hi> payable the twenty seventh of <hi>June 1666,</hi> which for non-payment was become forfeited. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants having had notice, and being acquainted with the Contents of the Plaintiffs Bill and Proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon against Mr. <hi>English</hi> and their Securities and Titles to the Premises, about a Week before the same came to hearing, exhibited their Bill here against Mr. <hi>English</hi> and the Plaintiffs to discover the reality of their Securities, and what was due thereupon, and prayed relief therein upon the Title of their Mortgage. <hi>20 Oct.</hi> the Plaintiff moved the Court again, which was between the times of the Decretal Order, and pending the Reference to the Master upon an Affidavit, that Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> and several others had Incumbrances on the Premises precedent to the Plaintiffs, to discharge the Order of the eighteenth of <hi>May</hi> last, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Proceedings at Law for the recovery of the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Premises had been stayed, and that they might be at liberty to proceed upon their Iudgment in Ejectment to recover the Possession, which the Court however thought not fit to grant, but continued the former Order. That the <hi>Lees</hi> by means thereof ceased the Prosecution of their Suit in this Court against the Plaintiffs, and while the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42102:87"/>Plaintiffs were tied up by the Order of this Court from getting possession, bought in a Mortgage made in <hi>1649.</hi> by Mr. <hi>English</hi> to Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> of part of <hi>Wigsel</hi> for <hi>1000 l.</hi> and a Statute in <hi>1656.</hi> acknowledged by Mr. <hi>English</hi> to Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> of <hi>800 l.</hi> for payment of <hi>400 l.</hi> and have extended the Statute on both the Mannors at not above the third part of the value, and by virtue thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to evict the Possession and to pay themselves as well the <hi>2000 l.</hi> and Interest, as the <hi>800 l.</hi> and <hi>1000 l.</hi> and Interest, before the Plaintiffs shall have any fruit of their Decree, and that the Defendants ought, and that the Plaintiffs have offered them upon their payment to them the <hi>8530 l. 14 s.</hi> and Interest, to assign their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, or else that the Defendants would accept what is due upon the Statute and Mortgage to <hi>Burrel,</hi> and thereupon assign them to the Plaintiffs, and yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do it.</p>
               <p>And so to be relieved in the Premises is the Prayer of the Bill.</p>

                  <p>THE Defendant <hi>John Lee</hi> the elder, to so much of the Bill as seeks relief concerning the Mannor of <hi>Wigsel</hi> by setting aside or prejudicing any Title he or the other Defendant hath, or for discovery thereof until he be satisfied the Mony in his Plea mentioned, for Plea saith, That about the one and twentieth of <hi>June 1665.</hi> the said <hi>English</hi> affirmed that he was seised in Feé of the Mannor of <hi>Wigsel</hi> free of Incumbrances, and the Defendant finding him in possession, and believing that he was so seised, and knowing nothing to the contrary in consideration of <hi>2000 l.</hi> paid by him, took a Conveyance of the Inheritance in Fee simple thereof from Mr. <hi>English,</hi> in his and the other Defendants Names, for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>2000 l.</hi> payable the twenty ninth of <hi>June 1666.</hi> whereof no part is paid, but the Estate absolute. That the Defendant at the time of the Conveyance or before, had no notice of the Plaintiffs Securities, or any of them; but long after hearing that Mr. <hi>English</hi> had incumbred the Premises with the Plaintiffs Securities, and by a Prior Mortgage to Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> for <hi>500 l.</hi> for securing <hi>1000 l.</hi> which was forfeited in <hi>November 1649.</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42102:87"/>part of <hi>Wigsel,</hi> and in <hi>November 1655.</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a Statute to Mr. <hi>Burrel</hi> of <hi>800 l.</hi> for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>400 l.</hi> which was also forfeited, did by advise of his Counsel for securing the Premises, convey to him and the other Defendant for <hi>1090 l.</hi> by him paid, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase in Mr. <hi>Burrel's</hi> Mortgage, and agree with him to extend the Premises, and for <hi>430 l.</hi> to assign the same as the Defendant should direct. That the Statute was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and the Defendant paid <hi>Burrel 430 l.</hi> who assigned the extended Premises as the Defendant did direct. That the Defendant made the Purchase of <hi>Burrel</hi> principally to secure his Title, and to protect from Incumbrances the Premises conveyed to him and the other Defendant, and to reimburse the several Sums of Mony by him paid with Damages, or at least so much as shall be really due on the said <hi>Burrels</hi> Mortgage and Statute, and demands Iudgment. And by Answer saith, That after his Purchase, and not before, he heard of the Plaintiffs Incumbrances, and heard also of <hi>Burrel's</hi> Mortgage and Statute; and and that before he bought <hi>Burrel's</hi> Mortgage and Statute he had notice of some Proceedings by the Plaintiffs had in this Court against Mr. <hi>English</hi> touching the Premises, but were no Parties thereto, but what the same were, referred to Records there and Proceedings at Law, and thereupon by advice of Councel he did purchase the said Mortgage, Lease and Extent <hi>Nov. 27. 1668.</hi> That the Agreement for the Mortgage and Statute with <hi>Burrel</hi> was intire, tho perfected with several Instruments, and the Consideration mentioned to be several, and <hi>Burrel</hi> refused to extend the Statute and assign the Extent, unless the Defendant paid him what was due on his Mortgage and Statute. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant submits, that if the Plaintiffs will let him enjoy his purchase Lands free from Incumbrances, to pay him the Purchase Mony and Damages, and will pay him what he paid <hi>Burrel,</hi> with Damages and Costs, if he will accept it.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42102:89"/>this Case. But as to the Manor of <hi>Monfield,</hi> in which the Defendants had no Estate before they bought in the Statute, the Court inclined that so much of <hi>Wigsel</hi> as was not in <hi>Burrel's</hi> Mortgage (for he could not extend on himself) <hi>Monfield</hi> should be accounted for at the real value, in order to discharge <hi>Monfield</hi> of the Extent; but not so as to prejudice the Extent in course of Law as to <hi>Wigsel:</hi> But that the Statute ought to protect <hi>Wigsel,</hi> as far as by any course of Law it might.</p>
                  <p>On the Argument of this Case was produced <hi>Higgon</hi> against <hi>Udal,</hi> and <hi>Medleton</hi> against <hi>Shelleh, 19 June Car. 1.</hi> for Presidents.</p>
                  <p>On the Hearing of this Case, which was a parallel Case, the Court would be satisfied there by Presidents before they would give any Relief against Purchasers in of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances to protect a real Title, and the Cause went no further here. But the Plaintiff, as the Chief Baron now said, brought his Bill in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> afterwards, and was there dismist.</p>
                  <p>And in the principal Case the Plea was allowed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Things in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on assignable in Equity, and how</note>THE Case was thus. There was a Sum of Mony provided by a Settlement of Lands to be raised for Daughters Portions; one of the Daughters marries and dies; before her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid her Husband takes Administration to her, and assigns all his Interest in that Portion to his Son by a former Wife. The Son by this Title (the Father being dead) sued in Equity for this Mony.</p>
               <p>It was insisted for the Defendants, That though things in action might be assigned here on a consideration by the party that had the Interest, and were recoverable here by the Assignee; and that a Release afterwards by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signor, unless it were without Notice and on consideration to him to whom the Release was, would not hurt the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeé yet here the Assignment being by an Administrator,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42102:90"/>and not the person that had it in his own right, this had never beén good, for there might be a Creditor to satisfie the Intestate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> did think there was a considerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwéen the assignment of the Party and of the Administrator, where the Administrator was a Stranger, or had not Right before, and no colour of Right but meerly by the Administration. But here in this Case the Administration was <hi>pro forma</hi> only, for here he had a Right to the Mony, as a Portion or Provision for his Wife, and every Man hath not ready mony to give Daughters, but their Portions are to be provided for by this means, and therefore its reasonable to advance or promote the establishing of them, so that they might be disposable by the Husband (who settles a Ioynture) as Mony it self may be. And so decréed for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>SIR <hi>John Stowel</hi> (whose Heir the Plaintiff is) was indebted to the Defendants Testator by Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Counterbond, the Defendants Testator having paid the Debts he was bound in as Surety for him. Sir <hi>John</hi> was sequestred, and his Estate exposed to Sale by the Parliament for his Loyalty to the late King. The Defendants Father bought a Farm of the Trusteés for Sale, part of Sir <hi>Johns</hi> Estate, and in the Purchase had allowance of his Debt by Iudgment and on the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, and paid the rest of the Purchase Mony, as was usual, by Bills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendants Testators Purchase was in <hi>1652.</hi> and he entred and held till <hi>1660.</hi> the Kings Restauration. He being dead, the Plaintiff who claimed under Sir <hi>John Stowel,</hi> exhibited a Bill to call the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to an account, and suggested, that the Land was conveyed by the Trustées in satisfaction of the Iudgment, and that by the Profits taken the Iudgment was satisfied, and therefore the Plaintiff ought to hold the Lands against the Iudgment which was extended for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>It was insisted, that for all the Profits the Defendants Testator took under the Sale, it was pardoned by the Act of Indempnity; And that the Defendants Testator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this Iudgment and this Bond, paid a great Sum of Mony for the Purchase. And yet it was offered to come to an account, if the Plaintiff on account would pay the Defendants the Debt due by Iudgment and on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbond, and the Mony paid for the Purchase. And upon that offer the Court decréeed it to an Account. Though

But as to the using of Depositions in a Cause dismist this difference was taken; that though where a Cause is dismist the matter of it not being proper for Equity to decrée, yet the Fact in this Cause proved may be used as Evidence in that Fact betwéen the same Parties when ever it shall come in question again. But when a Cause is dismist not upon that ground, but upon irregularity, as for that it comes by Reviver when it should come by original Bill, so that in truth there was never regularly any such Cause in the Court, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Proofs, these Proofs cannot be used; for Proofs cannot be exemplified without Bill and Answer; nor can they be read at Law without the Bill, on which they were taken, can be read. But this Bill of Reviver could not be read at Law, and therefore the Proofs taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it cannot be used here. And so upon long debate, and after several formal Arguments it was ruled about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term <hi>1669.</hi> in this very Cause by the Lord Kéeper.</p>
               <p>And now upon the hearing of this Cause, the endeavour on the Plaintiffs part was to prove a Notice in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of <hi>Bishops</hi> Contract, which was opposed by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. But the Notice being proved,<note place="margin">An Agreement for the Purchase with the <hi>Cestuy que trust</hi> of the Surplus not good unless the Trustees are Parties.</note> it was for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant insisted, that there was no ground to decree the Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by <hi>Bishop,</hi> it being made by a <hi>Cestuy que Trust</hi> of the Suplus only, and the Trustées no Parties, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Agreement by the Defendant <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined before any Bill brought by <hi>Bishop</hi> against the <hi>Cestuy que Trust;</hi> and the principal Trusteé (who being examined as a Witness) swears that he did disapprove of the Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Bishop,</hi> and would never consent to it. And it was farther insisted for the Defendant <hi>Simon,</hi> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greément with <hi>Bishop</hi> was not pursued, nor could Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> inforce the payment of the <hi>6750 l.</hi> it being to be paid as the Trustees and he should agrée, so that that was nocom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Agreement; and the Trustees disagreéing, and having executed the other to <hi>Simon</hi> the Defendant, the Agréement with <hi>Bishop</hi> ought not now to be decreéd, especially for the Plaintiff, who claimed the benefit of it by Devise only, which at the best was a Devise of an Equity on an Equity.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:42102:93"/>
               <p> But for the Plaintiff it was insisted, that the Trusteés had not by the Trust power to sell, they being to pay the Daughters Portions out of the Rents and Profits.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Trust to pay Portions out of Rents and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits at prefixt days gives the Trustees power to fell.</note>To which it was replyed by the Court, that the Trusts were not to pay the Portions out of the annual Rents and Profits, but out of the Rents and Profits, and those Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to be paid at prefixt days, which the annual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits would not do; and therefore conceived the Trustées might sell for that purpose within the intention of the Trust; and so declared he was of Opinion to dismiss the Bill, but withal said he would think further of it. <hi>Vide</hi> the end of this Cause in <hi>Cornbury</hi> against <hi>Middleton.</hi>

               <p>The Cause was first heard before the Master of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> and it was then ordered a Case should be drawn up and heard before the Lord Kéeper.</p>
               <p>And on Hearing before the Lord Kéeper <hi>7 Novemb. 1668.</hi> because the Cause appeared to be of weight and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, his Lordship ordered Copies of the Case to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Iustice <hi>Twisden</hi> and Iustice <hi>Wild,</hi> and will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with them and appoint a day to deliver his Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>29 April 1669.</hi> the Cause was heard by his Lordship, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with those Iudges, at which time it was by Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> insisted for the Plaintiff, that the Will was good ill Law if the same was executed, but could not compel an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at Law, and therefore Equity ought.

And if a Devise be to an Heir upon a Condition that he sell, this Condition is void; but yet it is good by way of Trust in Equity, for it lies within the power of an Ancestor to charge his Lands with a Trust, and the Heir must sell. And the Presidents of the Court do run, that the Heir is to sell, and cited <hi>Batersby</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> in the Lord <hi>Coventrys</hi> time, and <hi>Tennant</hi> against <hi>Brown, 18 Feb. 1659.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Fountain</hi> for the Plaintiffs. Originally this is a good Will, and the Land might have been sold; and if by any accident it be prevented, as by the death of the Executor, this Court ought to help it. And it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that if the Will had been to sell to pay Debts, it had béen good, and the Heir should have sold: And there is no difference between Debt and Legacies, and here the Mony is given for Legacies, but shall be raised by the Sale; and he relyed on it, that the Executor might have sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor <hi>Finch</hi> for the Defendants. There are two Questions:
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>1.</hi> What the Law is?</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>2.</hi> What the Equity?</item>
                  </list> The Law is against the Plaintiffs. If Land
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42102:94"/>be appointed to be sold for payment of Debts,<note place="margin">When Lands are appointed to be sold, and no person appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sell, the Executor shall sell.</note> and no person is appointed to sell, the Executor shall sell, because the Soul is concerned, which the Executor is to take care of. But it's otherwise in a voluntary disposition, as here; and it is not like the Case of <hi>Howel</hi> and <hi>Barns, 1 Cro. 328.</hi> for there the Executors were appointed to sell.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Ellis</hi> for the Defendants. The Devise is a void Devise in the Creation, because no person is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to sell; or if good in the Creation is void <hi>ex post facto,</hi> for no Bond of the Ancestor binds the Heirs, unless he be expresly named.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> doubted whether the Will be void in the Creation; for it's against a Rule in Law, to make it void, if by any construction it can be made good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twisden</hi> doubted that the Executor of the Executor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compelled to sell in this Case, the Sale not being to be made till after the death of the Executor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyld</hi> conceived the Devise good in the Creation, the intent appearing; and the Case in <hi>Leonard</hi> is the very Case, and was of Opinion, that the Executor of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor shall sell; but doubted whether the Heir be compelled to sell.</p>
               <p>Presidents on both sides were given in to the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and the Iudges. And <hi>18 May, 1669.</hi> the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> after advice with the Iudges in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Cause, ordered a Tryal of these Points in a feigned Action.</p>
               <list>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Whether <hi>Jane</hi> the Executrix had Power, and could by the Will have sold the Lands?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> Whether a Sale by her Executors (admitting such Sale to be actually made) be a good Sale?</item>
               </list>
               <p>And after Tryal either Party to resort of the Court for a final determination.</p>
               <p>Vpon the Tryal by consent of Counsel a special Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was found, and upon several solemn Arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Counsel on both sides at the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> the Court gave Iudgment unanimously on both Points for the Defendants. Thereupon the Defendants move to dismiss the Bill. And it is ordered that the Cause be set down for Hearing before the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> upon the Equity reserved.</p>
               <p>And now upon Hearing thereof before his Lordship, it was for the Plaintiff insisted, that it was plain by the Will that the Lands should be sold, and no person by Law can
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42102:94"/>sell but the Heir, and therefore the Heir must sell; and that Matter was not tryed, but the Matter tryed was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for it was not to the purpose. And the Presidents of the Court run, that the Heir should sell, and therefore though the other Issues tryed are against the Plaintiff, that is not, but remains in Iustice for the Plaintiff; and cited divers Presidents, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>The Case was thus. The Plaintiffs were Creditors of the Testator. The Defendants were his Executors, and Daughters Legatées. The Bill was to inforce the Sale of the Testators Lands for payment of his Debts by the Executor (who by Answer submit to sell, if the Court thought fit, having in truth sold part before.) And the Words of the Will were thus: <hi>As for my Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Goods and Chattles, I give and bequeath, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: After my Debts paid to my five Daughters 100 l. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, and to be paid at their Ages of twenty years: Also I give to my Wife, whom I make my Executrix, all the rest of my Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels.</hi>

And to be relieved against that Verdict and the Penalty of the Bond was the Prayer of the Bill, which alledged that the Damage was not considerable nor valuable, and therefore the Plaintiff ought to be relieved against the Verdict for the Penalty.</p>

               <p>THE Parties in Court signed an Order by consent to refer their matters to Arbitrators finally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and their Award to be final, and stand ratified by Decreé without any Appeal.

But it was an abuse to the Court, as it was conceived, to revoke it, for which the Court might justly lay the Party by the Heels.<note place="margin">Attachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Party revoking a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to an Award by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by Consent.</note> And so in this Cause an Attachment was awarded against him <hi>nisi causa.</hi> In this Case it was observed, that whereas formerly the course was upon Submission to award an Attachment against the Party failing, yet of late the Courts of Law do refuse to grant Attachments in such Cases,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42102:98"/>but leaves the Party to his Action, the Rule being Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Submission.</p>
               <p>In the principal Case the Arbitrators had determined some Matters, and had left others undetermined, and submitted those other Matters to the Court: And whether this was therefore such an Award (being but part of the Matters referred) as was fit for the Court to decrée, was the Question.

               <p>For the Defendant it was demurred unto, for that the Bond was in <hi>1648.</hi> and <hi>William Bushel</hi> in <hi>November</hi> after made a Settlement, <hi>ut supra,</hi> to which one of the Trustees was a Party. And for that there is no Issue of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Mother, and <hi>William Bushel,</hi> and the Plaintiff, a méer Stranger to <hi>William Bushel,</hi> being the Child of <hi>Dorcas</hi> by another Husband, and that the Conveyance, <hi>ut supra,</hi> ought reasonably to be intended for a performance of the Marriage Agréement, and at least that the Plaintiff ought not to have any Relief in Equity, it not appearing that any Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session hath gone according to the Bond, or that any Relief was till now sought, though it be one and twenty years since.</p>

The Executors proved the Will; and the Executor <hi>Alexander</hi> and others, as his Sureties, in <hi>1658.</hi> entred into a Recognizance to the Chamberlain of <hi>London,</hi> for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>10000 l.</hi> (which by the Will was first to be paid) before any others should have any benefit of his Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Restauration of the King the Lands of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Title reverted to the right Owners.

               </p>
               <p>And the first Question was, Whether the Recognizance should in Equity extend any further than only to make good to the Orphans so much as the Testators Estate considering the Losses aforesaid, and as it now was really worth?</p>
               <p>And it was insisted by the Counsel of the Sureties of the Executors, that it ought not to be binding any farther in Equity. For that if the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> had taken the Estate of the Testator into their Hands, it would have been in no better plight than now it is. And the intention of the Security was but that the Executor should not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploy or wast the Estate, which (as it was declared) they had not done, but were ready to account for what they had already received.</p>

               <p>Albeit it was insisted for the Orphans, that the Condition of the Recognizance was generally for payment of the <hi>10000 l.</hi> (and so it was) And the Executor <hi>Alexander</hi> had thereupon taken upon himself the absolute Ownership of the Estate, and managed it as his own.

Nevertheless for the Reasons before it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creéd as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And the next Question was, Whether the Lease held of the Church of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which had beén renewed by the Executors, and a Fine paid, and new Houses built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the Executors, should be taken to be part of the Testators Estate?</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>North's</hi> Bill was to prove this Will <hi>per Testes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Crompton's</hi> Bill was to be relieved upon the Trust of the Devise, as he supposed, after the Debts and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies paid, and to discover what the Debts were.</p>
               <p>These Causes came first to be heard <hi>8 Febr. 1670.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and Baron <hi>Wyndham,</hi> and then these two Questions were stirred by the Court.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether this were a Devise of Lands in Fée?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether Mr. <hi>North</hi> (the Plaintiff <hi>Crompton</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an implyed Trust) after Debts and Legacies paid, might not be admitted to aver against that Implication?</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff upon the Loan of <hi>90 l.</hi> had gotten a Bond from the Defendant of <hi>1600 l.</hi> for payment of <hi>800 l.</hi> and Iudgment thereupon. The Defendant in the Right of his Wife was entituled to certain Lands that were estated in other persons in Law in Trust for her.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is intire, and inequitable Equity will not apportion Relief for part.</note>The Bill was to have those Lands subjected to the Plaintiffs satisfaction here, inasmuch as the Defendant was intituled to the Trust in the Right of his Wife.</p>
               <p>But the Security being gotten from the Defendant when he was drunk, the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> would not give the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff any Relief in Equity, not so much as for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal he had really lent; and so the Bill was dismist.</p>

And the Bill did set forth divers advantges they had
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42102:107"/>in Trade by being Members of this Corporation, which others wanted. And the Bill did charge, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany having no Common Stock, the Plaintiff had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy at Law for his Debt, but did charge that their usage had been to make Taxes, and levy Actions upon the Members and their Goods, to bear the Charge of their Company to pay their Debts, and did complain that they now did refuse to execute that power, and did particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain against divers of the Members by Name, that they did refuse to meet and lay Taxes, and that they did pretend want of power by their Charter to lay such Taxes, whereas they had formerly exercised Power, and thereby gained Credit; whereupon the Plaintiff sent them <hi>2000 l.</hi> which was for the use and support of the Companies Charge, and so ought to be made good by them, and so prayed to be relieved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paschae 1656.</hi> this Bill was filed, and the Company ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Process, but would not appear, they having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by which they may be distrained: But divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Members being served in their natural Capacities, did appear and demur, for that they were not in that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty liable to the Plaintiffs demands. <hi>10 May 1666.</hi> On the Argument the Demurrer was allowed, and the Bill dismist as to them, and that dismission enrolled, and thereupon a Petition of Appeal was preferred to the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, admitting that in the ordinary course of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Chancery that Court could not help the Plaintiff.

And if upon return of the Process, the said Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not file an Appearance, or shall appear and not answer, the said Bill shall be taken <hi>pro confesso,</hi> and a Decree shall thereupon pass. But in case the said Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration shall appear and answer within the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, then the Court of Chancery shall proceed to examine what the Plaintiffs just Debt is, and shall decree the said Company to pay so much Mony as the same shall appear to amount unto, with reasonable Damages. And in case the Corporation shall not pay the Sum decréed within ninety days after the service of the said Decrée upon their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, Deputy Governor, Treasurer, Clerk or Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for the time being, then the Lords Spiritual and Temporal do farther order, adjudge and direct, that the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper for the time being shall order and decree that the Governor or Deputy Governor, and the twenty four Assistants of the said Company, or so many of them as by the Tenor of their Charter do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a <hi>Quorum</hi> for the making of Leviations upon the Trade or Members of the said Company for the use of the said Company, shall within such time as by the Lord Chancellor or Keeper shall be thought fit, make such a

And such a Leviation is to be put in Writing and signed with the Hand of the Governor, Deputy Governor and Assistants of the aforesaid Company for the time being, and so many of them as by the Constitution of the said Charter do make a <hi>Quorum</hi> shall not make or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn such Leviations, as aforesaid, the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper may issue Process of Contempt against them, as is usual against Persons in their natural Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And if by the said time so to be limited by the said Court of Chancery the said Mony so to be assessed shall not be paid, then and from thenceforth every Person of the said Company upon such a Leviation shall be made to be liable in his Capacity to pay his <hi>quota</hi> or proportion as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed. And the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper is to order or decree, that such Process shall issue against any such Member so refusing or delaying to pay his <hi>quota</hi> or proportion as is usual against Persons charged by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the said Court for any Duty in their several Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. And if the Total so returned and filed with the Register shall not amount to so much as shall be sufficient to satisfie the Sum decreed, with respect had to such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as shall make it appear that they are overcharged, or ought not to be charged at all, Then the said Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor or Lord Keeper for the time being may from time to time order that a new Leviation be made and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Registers of the Court of Chancery, of such Sum as shall be sufficient, by way of Supplement for that purpose, to the payment whereof every individual Person is to be bound in such manner as aforesaid.</p>

               <p>THIS Cause begins <hi>fol. 173.</hi> and being abated by the Plaintiffs inter marriage since the last Hearing, a Bill of Reviver was brought, and the Cause was reheard by the Lord Keéper, assisted with Iustice <hi>Wyld</hi> and Baron <hi>Windham</hi> the third of <hi>March 1670.</hi> And the Case appearing to be as before, it was for the Defendants insisted, that the Contract made by Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> did not bind,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cestui que trust</hi> of a Surplus hath but a bare possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sell.</note> and that he being but <hi>Cestui que trust</hi> of a Surplus, had no power to sell, for that it was against the very essence of the Trust for him to have a power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and it would be a vain thing for any Parent to settle his Estate by way of Trust to prevent his Sons impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent disposition of it, (which Sir <hi>William Middleton</hi> did here so settle his Estate with a design to keep a Hand on his Son,) if notwithstanding his Son might have power to sell it when he pleased.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The breach of an Agreement is not devisable.</note>And it was farther insisted on for the Defendant, that if the Agreément with <hi>Bishop</hi> were binding, yet the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs have no Title to have the benefit of that Agreement, for that the breach of an Agreement, as the Case was, was not devisable, and so the Plaintiff had no Title, Things in Action,<note place="margin">Equity consists purely in Action and is only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in a Court of Equity.</note> as this Case is, being not devisable.</p>

                  <hi>Windham</hi> was of Opinion that the benefit of this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not devisable: For Things that consist in Privity must be carried on in Privity, and Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> could not have inforced the Devisee, unless she had pleased to pay the Mony <hi>Bishop</hi> was to pay, and the remedy ought to be reciprocal</p>

                  <hi>Wyld.</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had an Equity to the residue after the Debt and Portions paid, and it was a Crime to sell a thing twice, and the Defendant was <hi>particeps Criminis,</hi> and so no Decree ought to be for him, but would have Sir <hi>Samuel Jones</hi> and the other Trustees for Sir <hi>William Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> in whom three parts of the four were vested in Point of Law, convey fourteen shares to the Lady <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and her Heirs.</p>
               <p>Lord Keeper agrees with <hi>Wyld</hi> that the clear Equity and Conscience was with <hi>Bishops</hi> Title, and that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> did interlope; but did much doubt upon the Devise. Yet forasmuch as <hi>Bishops</hi> Heir was a Defendant, and consents to the Devise by Answer, did Decree, that Sir <hi>Samuel Jones</hi> and the Six Clerks to whom he had conveyed by Order of this Court, should convey by consent of the Heir of <hi>Bishop</hi> fourteen shares to the Lady <hi>Cornbury</hi> and her Heirs.</p>
               <p>The Lord Keeper upon the Hearing by himself alone in <hi>June 1670.</hi> being of Opinion to dismiss the Bill, and the Court being now divided in Opinion, the Defendant <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> petitioned for a Rehearing, and had a Hearing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in <hi>July 1671.</hi> before the Lord Keeper, Master of the <hi>Rolls, Rainsford, Wyld</hi> and <hi>Windham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now upon this Rehearing, it was for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> insisted, that the Agreement with <hi>Bishop</hi> did not bind, for the reason <hi>supra;</hi> and farther, that the Agreement it self was imperfect, because the Mony was to be paid as the Trustees should agree, and they did never agree to it, but <hi>Henry Middleton</hi> the only acting Trustee did so soon as he heard of it, utterly disagreed to it; and also for that the Agreement with <hi>Bishop</hi> was not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, for the Agreement with <hi>Bishop</hi> was in <hi>June 1657.</hi> and by that the Conveyances were to be executed in <hi>August</hi> next, but those not so much as prepared, nor any thing done in time, and but <hi>250 l.</hi> paid, and the Defendant <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had paid above <hi>15000 l.</hi> and had a Conveyance by Deed and Fine of the whole thirty six shares (<hi>Bishops</hi> Contract being but for fourteen shares executed above
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42102:110"/>twelve years since) and had been in the possession of the whole thirty six shares ever since; and that the Company of the <hi>New River</hi> had bought in an other Water-Work, from Sir <hi>Edward Ford,</hi> which was united to that of the <hi>New River,</hi> and mixt with it, and could not be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that no distinct Account could be taken, and so it was impracticable to decree the performance of the Agreement with <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor could Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to perform the same.<note place="margin">Consent binds the Party, but shall not bind an other.</note> And if the City which was lately burnt had not been rebuilt, or any other loss had befallen the Water-Work, the said Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> could never have compelled the Lady <hi>Cornbury</hi> to pay the Mony; and the Heirs consent tho it may bind himself, shall not put a Bargain upon an other.</p>
               <p>But it was for the Plaintiff insisted, that the Mony <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> was to pay, was enough to pay all the Debts and Legacies of Sir <hi>William Middleton,</hi> and thereby all the Trusts precedent to Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> might have been satisfied, and so Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had a clear Title to the Surplus, and he was looked upon as the Owner, and the Contract with <hi>Bishop</hi> was in pursuance of the Trust, and he might by a Bill have compelled the Trustees to sell: And that the reason why the Agreement was not pursued in time, was because Sir <hi>Hugh Middletons</hi> occasions drew him to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and he writ a Letter to have it respited till he came back, which was not till after <hi>August.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Purchaser with notice.</note> And the Defendant <hi>Simon</hi> was a wilful Purchaser, with notice of the Agreement, and Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> would have performed with <hi>Bishop,</hi> if Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had not been perswaded by <hi>Simon;</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> did endeavour to take up Mony of Sir <hi>George Prat</hi> for that purpose, and that these doings of <hi>Simon</hi> were against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and that in Conscience the first Agreement ought to be performed, and the Court ought to decree with, and not against Conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Windham</hi> adheres to his first Opinion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Bill ought to be dismissed, for he was not satisfied that Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had any such Interest as he could contract for, nor is it well come to the Lady <hi>Cornbury,</hi> tho Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> might by a Bill inforce the Trustees to sell;<note place="margin">What a Man cannot transfer he cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige by Articles.</note> for what a Man may do himself, is not transferrable in all Cases; and what a Man cannot transfer, he cannot oblige by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. If Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> could not grant, he could not by the Articles bind; his Interest is but a meer possibility contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; in its creation its so. Sir <hi>William</hi> hath a power to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42102:110"/>charge<note place="margin">If <hi>Cestui que trust</hi> covenants that his Trustees shall convey, and he hath no means to force them to make such Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Equity ought not to decree him to procure them to convey, but to leave the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantee to his Covenant. Cases that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in Privity, are to be carried on in Privity.</note> and doth so by his Will, and Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> could not dispose in his Fathers life time, and what Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> should have is uncertain, for the Trusteés might sell so much as to perform the precedent Trust. Nor was it intended by Sir <hi>William,</hi> that Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> should sell. If Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had had the possession with this contingent Interest, it might have gone far; but Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had no possession. If Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had covenanted the Trusteés should convey, Equity ought not to decreé him to procure them to convey, but to leave the Covenanteé to his Covenant at Law; and by the Agreement the payment of the Mony is intangled, and doth not pursue the Trust; and Mr. <hi>Bishop</hi> could not inforce his Interest; nor is the Devisee bound to pay the Mony, nor shall she take it up or lay it down as she pleases. Cases that rest in Privity are to be carried on in Privity, and Strangers not to be ingaged in it. The Heir comes in as improper as the Defendant, and that cannot help it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyld.</hi> This is a Case in Equity and in Conscience, and this Court is to help that side that hath Conscience. The Case is on a Trust, and that proper here, and an Interest in a Trust is in Equity assignable or devisable.<note place="margin">A Fine of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon passeth but his own Estate.</note> And if Land be conveyed for payment of Debts and Legacies, and what remains to be to the Heir, the Heir may dispose, and the Fine to <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> doth nothing. For its but the Fine for one Tenant in Common which passeth but his own share. Possibily a Fine and non-claim may bar in Equity, but not here, for a Bill was presently filed. Notice is all in all in the Case; and its against good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> to enjoy; and the Court must judge with Conscience, and not against Conscience. If this be an Interest its devisable;<note place="margin">Circuity of Action.</note> and its but Circuity of Action to bring the Heir to revive; for if he will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Estate to the Devisee, she must bring a new Bill against him. And concluded, that there ought to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for the Plaintiffs, but no Action to be but of the <hi>7650 l.</hi> to be paid by the Defendant, and to convey fourteen shares of the thirty six shares, and the mesne Profits to go against Interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Interest to be considered as it was at the time of the Contract, and not at the time of its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                  <hi>Rainsford</hi> conceived the Plaintiff ought to be relieved, for Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> had an equitable Interest that might be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in Equity, tho it was in its creation contingent; and we are not to take our measure as it stood in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as it stood when the Contract was made with Mr. <hi>Bishop,</hi> and he that may transfer may covenant. That

               <p>The Master of the <hi>Rolls</hi> agreed with <hi>Rainsford</hi> and <hi>Wyld,</hi> and looked upon the Agréement with <hi>Bishop</hi> to be in pursuance of the Trust.</p>
               <p>The Lord Keeper when he first heard this Cause, was of Opinion to dismiss the Bill; but that was on a mistake, for he did conceive that all the Trustees had conveyed to <hi>Simon Middleton,</hi> whereas it seems that <hi>Henry Middleton</hi> (who was but one of the Trustees) had conveyed to the said <hi>Simon.</hi> Its a Cause of great consequence, and the Trustees were trusted as well for Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> as the others, and conceived the Plaintiffs ought to be relieved. <hi>Bishop</hi> hath the first Agreement, and <hi>Simon Middleton</hi> the second, and Equity ought to decree with the first, and the Fine and Conveyance carries no more from <hi>Henry</hi> than his fourth part, and carries Sir <hi>Hughs</hi> Equity no farther; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, That out of the three parts remaining, fourteen shares of the thirty six parts shall be conveyed by the six Clerks to the Lady <hi>Cornbury</hi> and her Heirs, and no account of mesne Profits, but those to go against Interest. And as to <hi>Fords</hi> Water-Work, if it can be severed it cannot be taken into the Decree; but if it cannot, there must be an allowance for it, and so it was decreed accordingly. And whereas the said thirty six parts were charged with a Rent of <hi>500 l. per annum</hi> to the Crown in Fee, and <hi>100 l. per annum</hi> to <hi>Henry Middleton</hi> for life, and Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> in his Agreement with <hi>Bishop,</hi> had covenanted to discharge the fourteen shares he had agreed to sell <hi>Bishop</hi> from those Rents. It was farther decreed, that the Plaintiff should enjoy the fourteen shares discharged of those Rents, and that the other twenty two shares should be subject to the Plaintiffs indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity therein, notwithstanding it was insisted, that Sir <hi>Hughs</hi> Covenant to discharge the fourteen shares of those Rents was meerly personal, and did not, nor could charge the whole Rents upon the twenty two shares.</p>

               <p>THere was a Tryal at Barr touching the Title of the Master of the Hospital of St. <hi>Katharines,</hi> which the Plaintiff claimed by a Grant from the <hi>Queen</hi> Consort that now is; and the Defendant held and enjoyed by two Grants, one from <hi>Henerietta Maria,</hi> the Quéen Dowager; another from his Majesty that now is, before his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>

                  </note> Against the Foundation of this Title the Defendants Counsel objected, That a Limitation of the Patronage <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis succedentibus</hi> by Charter is void, for such a desultory kind of Inheritance cannot be limited but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, just as the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwal</hi> was by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>11 E. 3.</hi> limited to the Kings eldest Son for the time being.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowson <hi>in esse</hi> and the Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of an Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal newly created</note>But <hi>Hale</hi> Chief Iustice and whole Court resolved to the contrary; for they took a difference betwéen an Advowson in <hi>Esse,</hi> and the Patronage of an Hospital newly created; for the Land or an Advowson, 'tis true, no desultory kind of Inheritance can be limited without Act of Parliament, because then he who had Right could not always know against whom to bring his Action: But of the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of an Hospital newly founded there can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Right, and therefore at the very first Institution it may be limited as the King pleases, like the Case of a Rent <hi>de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the several Patents were produced on each side, wherein the Master of the Hospital had béen granted in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, yet resolved by <hi>Hale,</hi> and the whole Court, that all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42102:112"/>such Grants were void: For the Master of that Hospital,<note place="margin">Master of an Hospital, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive not granta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Reversion.</note> when he is seized in Feé in Right of the Hospital, and of an Estate in Fee simple, there can be no Reversion to grant. Therefore this Case is not to be compared to the Grant of an Office in Reversion, but is more like the Case of a Prebendary or a Donative, which cannot be granted in a Reversion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Then it was objected by the Plaintiff, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants Grant from the Queén Dowager was void, because there was a former Grant which the Quéen Dowager made to one Mr. <hi>H Mountague</hi> who was alive at the time of the Grant to the Defendant. The Defendant shewed that the Grant to <hi>H. Mountague</hi> was void, because it was <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend' post mort</hi> Sir <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and so a Grant in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, which was held a clear Answer.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">Diversity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Grant of the Mastership of an Hospital and a Patent for Land.</note>
                  <hi>4.</hi> It was resolved, That in a Patent which grants the Mastership of an Hospital, the words are not to be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely examined as in a Patent of Land or other Office; for in this Case it is sufficient, if there be Words of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination only, because the Patenteé is not in by the Patent alone, but by the original Constitution upon the Foundation.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> It was said by <hi>Hale,</hi> that though here the Question be touching the Interest of a Queen Dowager in the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage when there is no Queén Consort, yet it seemed to him that if there be a Queén Dowager and Quéen Consort both at the time of the voidance of the Hospital, the Quéen Dowager shall present.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6.</hi> If the Dowagers Grant be good, when there is a Quéen Consort, it is much more so when there is none; and if there could yet remain a scruple, the Kings Grant and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation clears it; for if there be no Consort nor Dowager doubtless the Kings Presentation is good: And this alone is sufficient to support the Defendants Title.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff replyed, That the Kings Presentation in such Case was good only by way of a provisional supply until a Consort come, and then was to cease.</p>
               <p>Which all the Court denyed; for the Master by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency gains a Feésimple, which cannot be determined by the determination of the Plaintiffs Interest; as in the Case of the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwal:</hi> If the King let the Land, the Lease is void when the Prince is born. But if he present to an Advowson, the Clerk continues.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Plaintiff seéing the Opinion of the Court against him, became nonsuited.</p>

And as to the pretence of an Agreément be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Charles</hi> and the Defendant, that notwithstanding the Decrée the Estate should remain still a Mortgage in the Defendants hands, there was no proof of any such Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Consent, but only told <hi>Charles</hi> he would come to an account; but there being Dealings and Accounts betwéen the Defendant and <hi>Charles,</hi> it was declared by the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> (who first heard this Cause in <hi>July 1671.</hi>)<note place="margin">General Words cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

               <p>But then it was insisted for the Plaintiff, that he being no party to the Decree was not bound thereby, and that he had an Equity to redeem, and that the Mortgage was not to be taken to be more ancient than from the time of the Assignment to the Defendant, for that an Account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then stated with <hi>Greenvil,</hi> and he paid off, there was no Account to be precedent to that, and so could not be taken to be elder than <hi>1650,</hi> and that so the Plaintiff ought to be admitted to redeém, and the rather, for that the Defendant had notice (which was admitted) of the Déed <hi>14 Car. 1.</hi> by which the Plaintiff claims before he took the Conveyance from <hi>Greenvil;</hi> and whether the Plaintiff should redéem the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> doubted, but took time to consider.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Wyndham</hi> was of Opinion as this Case was, that the Plaintiff ought not to be admitted to redeém.</p>
               <p>Iudge <hi>Wyld.</hi> There is no Fraud in the Settlement <hi>14 Car. 1.</hi> and a Decrée against Tenant for Life will not bind in the Remainder in the Case of an Estate at Law; and he did not sée why it should bind in Equity, and so he conceived the Plaintiff was relievable.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Equity on an Equity.</note>Chief Iustice <hi>Hale.</hi> By the Growth of Equity on Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Heart of the Common Law is eaten out, and legal Settlements are destroyed; and was of Opinion, there is no colour for a Decrée.

And a Decrée to foreclose a Tenant in Tail shall bind his Issue in an Equity of Redemption, because that is a Right set up only in a Court of Equity; and so may be here extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; and the Estate moved from <hi>Charles</hi> to the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageé, and not from the Plaintiff; and <hi>Charles</hi> was the visible Possessor and Owner. And its a great sore, that Mortgageés are but Bayliffs; and the Limitation to <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was but voluntary, and so the Plaintiffs pretence is not to be supported against a Purchaser, for so a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee is; and here its made absolute by the Decree; and if there be divers Remainders of the Equity, there is no reason to make them all Parties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> concurred with him, and said he, it goes current, that if a Mortgage be twenty years old, the Mortgagée shall have no Interest on Interest: But herein he is not satisfied, especially in this Case, where the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant could not get into possession by reason of the Estate for Life to <hi>Dorothy,</hi>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42102:115"/>of <hi>Derby</hi> his Son, the Defendant, opposed this Lease, being made by Tenant for Life, and between Baron and Feme, but by the Mediation of certain Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Earl <hi>Charles</hi> and his Mother came to a new Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the year <hi>1660.</hi> That she shall have the one Moiety of the Profits of the Isle, and he the other. In <hi>1661.</hi> They came to a new Agreement, that he should in lieu of the Agreement pay his Mother <hi>5000 l. per annum,</hi> and in the close of the Deed appoints his Receiver for the Isle of <hi>Man</hi> to pay it. All these Agreements were made by the Countess on behalf of the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> to enable him to receive the <hi>5000 l.</hi> and then the Countess dyes.</p>
               <p>It was decréed by the Master of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> shall have his <hi>500 l.</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and his person to be charged, and the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> shall not be forced to the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> which is the place origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally charged; for by the last Agréement he is to pay <hi>500 l per annum</hi> absolutely, and in lieu of the Profits let the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> make what he will of them; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Receiver to pay it is but directory, and if the Receiver do not pay it, the Earl must.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Isle of <hi>Man</hi> out of the power of the Court.</note>
                  <hi>Maynard</hi> and others of the Plaintiffs Counsel held that the Court could not by any Decrée bind the Isle of <hi>Man;</hi> nor if they should decrée it, could they execute the Decrée there, it being out of the power of any Sheriff. They also held that the Letter of Attorny being determined by the Countesses death, that the Court would not have made a Decreé for the Earl, though her Administrator is Defendant, unless in the Case of a Marriage Agréement, and that it was proved those Agreements were made on his behalf. Afterwards Sequestration was awarded against the Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon a Question arose, What time of Priviledge a Péer hath <hi>(viz.)</hi> whether twenty or ten days before and after Session of Parliament?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> sent to the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> and others to advise in it, and they produced two Orders in the House of Lords,<note place="margin">Priviledge of Peers in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it commences and when it ends.</note> whereby it appeared they declared their Priviledge to commence from the <hi>Teste</hi> to the Writ of Summons for their first coming to Parliament. And that upon every Session and Prorogation their Priviledge is for twenty days after such Session. And it is said in the Orders, that it is a sufficient time for them to come from
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42102:116"/>all parts of the Kingdom, and to return, and are in those Orders desired to take notice of it and of the reason of it.</p>
               <p>These Orders are, the one of the 24th of <hi>May 1624.</hi> the other of the 27th of <hi>January 1628.</hi> entred into the Iournal of the Book of the Lords House.</p>
               <p>But it is said, the Commons never agreed hereto and therefore think themselves not bound by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This Sequestration was executed accordingly; but the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> soon after dying, and the Estate being intailed, the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> lost the rest of his Wifes Portion.</p>

B.</hi> sealed it not, so that in Law it was void against <hi>G. B.</hi>) makes another Lease to Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> for threé Lives, which Lease was for divers years enjoyed till all those three Lives dyed. <hi>Tisdel</hi> being dead, <hi>Cook</hi> takes a Lease of <hi>Duncomb,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Tisdel,</hi> for <hi>400 l.</hi> Fine. <hi>George Bampfield</hi> comes from beyond Sea, and sets on foot his Title for a third part. The Matter was by Reference put to Arbitration (the point of Trust or no Trust being before by direction tryed by a Verdict for <hi>Cook,</hi> that <hi>G. B.</hi> his Name was used in Trust for <hi>Tho.</hi>) and <hi>G. B.</hi> having by Tryal at Law recovered one third part of the Premisses, the Arbitrators awarded, that <hi>G. B.</hi> should permit <hi>Cook</hi> to enjoy the said third part, paying <hi>16 l.</hi> yearly to <hi>G. B.</hi> during his Life. <hi>G. B.</hi> dyed; the Plaintiff exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits a new Bill against <hi>Edward B.</hi> reciting the former, and prays Relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duncomb</hi> dyed, <hi>Aston</hi> succèeds in the Prebendary; and before the last Bill <hi>Aston</hi> for <hi>120 l.</hi> makes a new Lease to <hi>Edward B.</hi> for three Lives, yet in being. <hi>Edward B.</hi> was bound to <hi>Cook</hi> that <hi>G.B.</hi> should perform, which in all <hi>George</hi> his time was on all sides executed. <hi>Aston</hi> received the Rents of <hi>Cook</hi> after <hi>Duncombs</hi> death: <hi>27 Novemb. 23 Car. 2.</hi> It was decréed that <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>George B.</hi> should pay to <hi>Cook</hi> all the Profits received, deducting the <hi>16 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and that <hi>Edward B.</hi> should assign his Lease to <hi>Cook</hi> for threé such Lives as he should name: And on a Bill of Review this Decree was confirmed by the Lord Keeper <hi>Finch 10th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> instant, <hi>Ellis</hi> and <hi>Littleton</hi> concurring.</p>
               <p>The Objections against the Decree were, First, That the Lease of <hi>Duncomb</hi> was not good in Law, being of the whole in Possession and Reversion, when at the making thereof <hi>George B.</hi> was Tenant for Life for one third part; which was not much denied, and being avoided by Act of Parliament this Court might not supply it; and <hi>Aston</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:42102:119"/>the Successor is not bound by any Transaction of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count made in the time of his Predecessor against an Act of Parliament.<note place="margin">Lessee of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth his Lease and after the day pays the Mony, and then surrenders, and takes a Lease from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, he hath good Equity against the Mortgagee. If the Prebend dye, Equity shall not make the second Lease good against the Successor. Chancery can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity against an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> And it was as free for <hi>Edward B.</hi> to deal for an Estate with <hi>Aston</hi> the Prebend as for any other Man, and that if there was any Equity to support the Lease against the Lessee or his Assigns, or against <hi>Duncomb</hi> Predecessor to <hi>Aston,</hi> that Equity should not bind <hi>Aston.</hi> Put Case the Lessee of a Prebend or Bishop should mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his Lease or part of it, and after the day pay the Mony, and then surrender and take a Lease from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend; he hath good Equity against the Mortgagee; but if the Prebend dye, this Equity shall not make the second Lease good against the Successor against the Statute which binds all Men and hath no saving of such Rights of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and the Chancellor may not add to a Statute to make a Saving which the Statute hath not made. An Infant bound by Statute of Fines should not have been helpt in Equity.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding the Decree was confirmed; for by the Surrender of <hi>Tho.</hi> who was <hi>Cestuy que Trust,</hi> the Lease in Equity was avoided as to the then Prebend, and therefore shall never be set on foot against a Successor. <hi>Duncomb</hi> takes <hi>400 l.</hi> Fine and resigns when there can no more Fine be made, and <hi>Aston</hi> would now set on foot the Statute and a new Fine, which appears against the Practice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>2d</hi> Objection. The Purchaser from <hi>T.B. viz. R.P.</hi> took a new Lease for three Lives, whereby the Purchaser had the full benefit of his Purchase, and those new Lives being now all dead, it is no reason that <hi>Cook</hi> should set on foot the Interest of the old Lease again.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lord Keeper.</hi> Nor shall <hi>Aston,</hi> nor <hi>Edward B.</hi>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42102:122"/>then having Issue the Defendant <hi>Thomas</hi> by his first Wife, and inheritable to the special Intail,) agreéd (as tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) to settle the Land on his second Wife and their Heirs by her; and pending the Suit <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conveyed away the Lands to <hi>Thomas</hi> the Defendant. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Father being dead, <hi>Penelope</hi> his Widow and her second Husband exhibits a Bill to have the Lands setled on her for her Life, <hi>viz. 300 l per annum</hi> part thereof, and to have other part thereof lyable to Debts; for <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Father of the Defendant, had so ordained by his Will in Writing. After Publication in this Cause, <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Son exhibits his Bill against <hi>Norcliff</hi> and his Wife, grounded on an Agreément by <hi>Penelope</hi> with <hi>Thomas</hi> to accept of certain Lands, part of the Lands in Question of <hi>100 l. per annum,</hi> in lieu of Ioynture, Dower, and all Demands, which was executed seven years by enjoyment by <hi>Penelope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Questions arose. <hi>1.</hi> Whether the Agréement of <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Father, to settle the Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife, did bind <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Son, by reason that he was entituled in Equity to an Estate Tail in the Land, and therefore should not be bound by his Fathers Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For if the Land had béen setled in Tail, it could not bind the Issue, and the Right of an Estate Tayl is descended on him; And the Plaintiff sued for her Ioynture raised on Equity, but it is a puny Equity to <hi>Thomas</hi> the Grandchild. The Considerations are on both sides the same, <hi>viz.</hi> Marriage Agréement and Portion; only the Defendant <hi>Thomas</hi> insisted, that his Agreément by which he claims was in general Terms for Lands of <hi>300 l. per annum,</hi> and not for Lands in Question particularly. And also if it were for some of the Lands by particular Names with Covenant that those particulars were <hi>300 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> if such Agréement did bind as to the particulars, yet the Covenant for the value, nor the Will did not bind the other Lands so as to have the value supplyed out of the other Lands agreéd to be entailed. And though if the Lands had béen entailed, though the Father might have cut off the Intail by Fine and Recovery, yet without Fine or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery they could not; And there is no Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor any Attempt or Procéedings towards levying a Fine or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42102:123"/>
               <p> As to this Point the Lord Keéper <hi>Finch</hi> gave no reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; but said, he conceived a difference in the Case, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>Penelope's</hi> Agréement was in general for Lands of <hi>300 l. per annum,</hi> or particular; and if parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly relating to the Lands in Question; Whether so much was mentioned as amounted to <hi>300 l. per annum,</hi> or, which in effect is the same? Whether it were not for <hi>300 l. per annum</hi> Lands, part of the Lands formerly agréed by the Great Grandfather to be intailed, or in general for <hi>300 l. per annum</hi> Lands, without relation to the Lands <hi>ut supra,</hi> by the Great Grandfather to be entailed. And therefore there was much dispute as to the Fact in that Point.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> though he was not positive in the main Point, yet said that as to the Agreément by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether to be avoided by the Son, now Defendant, that in case the Lands had béen intailed <hi>de facto;</hi> and agreed, no Agreément could bind the Issue without Fine or Recovery or other legal Barr;<note place="margin">Where Equity creates the Estate it shall be guided by Conscience.</note> yet he said the Agreement to entail was not an Intail; and though it raised an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity against him that made it, yet that Equity is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Court to be governed as Conscience directs by this Court: And said the Statute <hi>de donis</hi> was an ambitious Act in favour of the Lords against the King; and for that vouched the Lord <hi>Elsmere.</hi> But before he had said this there were some Proposals of Agreement: And at length the Case was composed.</p>
               <p>There was a second Point which was fully proved, that must have ended the Cause <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Agreement by <hi>Penelope, ut supra.</hi> But a Dispute arose about the Proof, Whether the Witness that proved the Agreement could be read? For the Agreement was not set forth in the Answer to <hi>Penelope's</hi> Bill, but was proved in that Cause; and it was set forth in the Bill against <hi>Penelope</hi> and her Husband, but no Proof thereof in that Cause; so it was proved in one, and set forth in another Cause. To salve which defect, the Defendant <hi>Thomas</hi> moved, and had an Order, that the Depositions in either Cause might be used in both,<note place="margin">Depositions read in both Causes.</note> which Order was after Publication in the first Cause, wherein the Proof was made; but before Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the second Cause; so as the Defendant in that Cause had the advantage, having the Liberty to see what was produced against them, and had liberty to examine.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42102:123"/>
               <p> Sir <hi>John Churchil</hi> who was of Councel for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Thomas,</hi> yielded that they could not be read by his Client. But for my part I know no prejudice to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, being warned by the Order, and might examine in the second Cause. But the Proposals of compounding the Cause took off all Debates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> The Defendant <hi>Norcliff</hi> had a subsequent Order, saving all Exceptions. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Question grew, Whether the Conveyance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokable, or not? For if it were revokable the Lord Kéeper would kéep on the Sequestration, though the Decrée was not for Lands, but for Personal Duty.

Afterwards and before the Decreé or Bill, the Father revokes the former Vses, and by the same Deed limits an Estate to his Son; In which second Deed there is no power of Revocation; but though it was voluntary and for natural Affection, was absolute.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>9 Jac.</hi> SIR <hi>James</hi> setled certain Freéhold Lands in <hi>Westmorland,</hi> to the use of himself for life, the Remainder to <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, and the Heirs Males of his Body, the Remainder to <hi>Allen</hi> his second Son, and the Heirs Males of his Body, the Remainder to his own Heirs; and covenanted to settle Copyhold Lands in the same manner, and died <hi>10 Jan.</hi> The Freéhold was setled, but <hi>non constat</hi> the Copyhold were, but Sir <hi>Henry</hi> surrendred to the use of him and his sequel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1649.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry</hi> having suffered a Recovery of the Freéhold, Covenants with <hi>Willoughby, &amp;c.</hi> to settle the Freéhold Lands on himself for life, the Remainder of part to <hi>Katherine</hi> his Wife for part of her Iointure, the Remainder to the Heirs Males of himself by <hi>Katherine;</hi> the Remainder to the Heirs Males of his Body, the Remainder to <hi>Allen,</hi> and the Heirs Males of the Body of <hi>Allen,</hi> the Remainder to the Heirs of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and covenanted with the same Persons to settle the Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42102:127"/>by Surrender to himself for life, the Remainder to <hi>Katharine</hi> in full of her Iointure, the Remainder to the Heirs Males of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> by <hi>Katharine,</hi> the Remainder to the Heirs Males of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> the Remainder to <hi>Allen</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Bellingham</hi> coming to make a Surrender of the Copyhold, fell sick by the way, but made a Letter of Attorny to others to do it, but died before it was done. The Fréehold Lands remained to Sir <hi>James</hi> the Son, and the Heirs Male of <hi>Allen</hi> now exhibited their Bill against <hi>Thomas Lowther</hi> and <hi>John Wentworth,</hi> to whom the Copyhold Lands descended as Heirs general for want of Surrender. The scope of this Bill was to have Assurances of the Copyhold, and to be relieved against Actions at Law.</p>
               <p>There were divers matters in the Bill, but this was the effect and substance of the Case upon the Plea. And it was said that this Covenant was but voluntary as to <hi>Allen,</hi> because he was no party to the Covenant, nor within the consideration of the Marriage or Portion. And it might be fraudulent as to <hi>Allen,</hi> and yet be good as to <hi>Katharine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deed fraudulent as to one, and good as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> and the Issues of the Marriage, as it was in Sir <hi>John Jacobs</hi> Case. And if one make a voluntary Conveyance to a younger Son, the same shall not be made good in Equity against the Heir at Law, if it be a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Conveyance, and defective in Law; and if it had been executed by Surrender in the principal Case, yet Sir <hi>Henry</hi> might have cut it off by the Recovery.</p>
               <p>The Answer to these Objections endeavoured and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was. <hi>1st.</hi> That Sir <hi>Henry</hi> here expresly intended to preserve the Name and Male of his Family before his Daughters, though they should happen to be his Heirs; for he limits the Estate to his own Heirs Males, and immediately after to <hi>Allen,</hi> and his Heirs Males, which was likewise done by Sir <hi>James</hi> his Father, and that was consideration enough, <hi>(viz.)</hi> not only his Name, but his Blood as his Brother was; and the maintenance of his Name in his Blood was not only a good consideration, but such as prevailed with old Sir <hi>James</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> above the affection of the Heirs general: And the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Deéds of Covenant is not only the Marriage of <hi>Katharine,</hi> but continuing the Lands in his Name and Blood. And the Covenant binds <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs; and though the Covenant be with others, and not with <hi>Allen,</hi> yet the Covenant is obliging to the Heir, and puts
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42102:127"/>a tie and obligation on Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to settle Lands, and a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</note> and so differs from a voluntary Conveyance without Execution; for there is no tie in that Case, no Man at all is bound by it: It is meerly void, and so is not this Covenant. And though it be true, that if the Surrender had been made, and thereby <hi>Henry</hi> Tenant in Tail, with Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Allen,</hi> yet he might by Recovery have barred the Remainder; yet unless he had made some attempt that way, his intent and covenant stands still good, and differs from <hi>Worsleys</hi> Case <hi>fol.</hi> for there was an act and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cut it off, but no such here.</p>
               <p>Lord Keeper. Can the Plaintiffs amend your Case on proof:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Churchil,</hi> They cannot; for we admit the whole Bill.</p>
               <p>Lord Keéper. If Sir <hi>Henry</hi> had had another Son by a former Wife, you could have no relief against him on this Covenant, which as to the Plaintiff is meérly volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and matter of kindness. And if Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> were both in life, <hi>Allen</hi> could not inforce Sir <hi>Henry</hi> to execute the Covenant; yet <hi>Katharine</hi> might; for it were to decree that to be done by <hi>Henry,</hi> which <hi>Henry</hi> might undo the next day; and so it was resolved in <hi>Hockleys</hi> Case, the younger Brother goes away with <hi>1500 l. per annum,</hi> and the Heir general has but <hi>200 l. per annum,</hi> Copyhold. And for the reasons given dismist the Bill <hi>14 Jan. 1674.</hi>

               <p>Lord Reéper. It may be so where Legacy will bear the charge of Suit, but not else, and delivered his Opinion accordingly. But the Defendant being put to prove the

               <p>IN the late times of the great Troubles, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Great Seal, as they were then called, had Iurisdiction given them in the Case of Alimony betwéen Mr. <hi>Whorewood</hi> and his Wife.<note place="margin">A Decree for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limony <hi>quousque</hi> Cohabitation.

Mr. <hi>Whorewood</hi> for six years paid not the <hi>300 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> The Decreé was confirmed by the general Act touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudicial Procéedings.<note place="margin">

               <p>On the Defendants part it was said, that the Act being made when there was a Suspension of Ecclesiastical Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions, the same was conferred to the Commissloners who were to act according to the Laws Ecclesiastick, and so ought this Court now to do; and it cannot be conceived when there is a Separation and allowance of Alimony <hi>quousque, &amp;c.</hi> that a single declaration of the Husband without consent of the Wise should frée him from Alimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for then he might so declare and avoid the Sentence the next day: But it must be by her Consent, or on clear proof that it is méer wilfulness in her, and that the fear she had was justly removed, which in this Case appears by her Oath not to be. And she had great cause to be in fear by sixteen years strugling against the Sentence, and his Exasperation by her Prosecution of him, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his Bill of Review had now foreclosed him to sue for Relief by way of Original Bill: And the Decree is for <hi>300 l. per annum</hi> till Co-habitation by Consent, which Cohabitation must be by mutual Consent.</p>

               <p>The Lord Kéeper. I cannot decrée a Separation.

But she shall immediately return, and if not, she shall have no benefit of the Alimony till she do so, but take her remedy in the Court Ecclesiastical.</p>

The nature of a Legacy. Legacy not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachable by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Infant Executor Assents to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy. Trustee of a Term after the assent of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor sells it <hi>bona fide,</hi> if good against Creditors</note> Yet the Legatee upon his Bill in the Court shall refund, and this as well as where it is Legative <hi>in specie,</hi> as a Horse, or a <hi>1000 l.</hi> actually paid; for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies are not due till the Debts be paid, and a Legacy being paid remains as a Legacy in the Hands of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatée after payment: And hence it is that a Legacy is not attachable by Foreign Attachment, being it may work a wrong to the Creditors, who are third Persons, and can have no day in Court in that Suit to interplead. And for this reason if an Infant Executor assent, it is no good assent if there be not other Assets for Debts, which the Common Law provides for the security of Creditors, much more shall this Court provide for their security: But if after such assent, <hi>John Chamberlain</hi> the Son had sold the Leases to a third Person <hi>bona fide,</hi> this had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Creditors, for he had a good Title in Law, and the Purchaser should not be prejudiced by this trust for the Creditors. And in this Case it was also ruled, that if an Executor make a <hi>Devastavit,</hi> and die,<note place="margin">Executor of an Executor liable to a Devastavit made by the first Executor.</note> his Executor is liable to make good of the <hi>quantum</hi> of the <hi>Devastavit</hi> to the Creditors, if he hath Assets from the first Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> A Case was cited, wherein it appeared that the Spiritual Court insisted to have security to answer Debts before the Executor should pay the Legacy, and a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was prayed, but denied. And in this Case because it appeared that the Defendant <hi>Thomas Chamberlain</hi> was not born at the time of the decease of the said <hi>John Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> the Grandfather, nothing could vest in the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and therefore the whole Terms remained in the said Defendant <hi>John Chamberlain;</hi> and for this reason the Bill against the Infant was dismist.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42102:135"/>there was no such Lease or Covenant, because they have a counterpart of a Lease of the same Land to the same <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Tanner</hi> for ninety nine years, and determinable on the same lives under the same Rent. In which counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part there is no such Covenant to renew, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart the Defendant never had.</p>

               <p>Lord Keeper. The exception of Leases, <hi>ut supra,</hi> gave notice of former Leases, and therefore you must take notice of the Covenants in them.</p>
               <p>It was answered thereto, that the Exception is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, not particular of this Lease, and is but for three lives; but this in effect is for four lives. And it might as well be good for five or six lives, or of the Inheritance; and the course in Purchases is to take such general Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; As in this Case when a Mannor is sold, it is not usual to peruse all Counterparts; and many times they are wanting, and then it will make it very difficult to sell a Mannor in the next Country.

               <p>Lord Keéper. An use to the Husband and Wife, and after to their Issue, they then having none, is all one as if limited to them and the Heirs of their Bodies; and the Issue takes nothing as a Purchasor.</p>

               <p>AMong many other Questions, which arose in the Case, some were about the operation of a Fine with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and Nonclaim thereon, of which the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor having heard the Cause several days, took time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, and now declared his Opinion at large.</p>
               <p>The Bill was to have Articles made on good and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consideration sixty years before decreed, by which the Lands in Question were to be setled on <hi>A.</hi> the Father for life, Remainder in Tail to him whose Son and Heir the Plaintiff is.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Fine and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim.</note>The Defendants insisted on a Fine and Nonclaim, which the Plaintiff would <hi>inter alia</hi> avoid by Infancy of himself and of his Father, and of Entry made by himself within five years after the death of <hi>A.</hi> who was Tenant for life.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor in several other Points touching Notice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was of Opinion for the Plaintiff, but dismist the Bill on Consideration of the Fine.</p>

                  <item>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> And as they are restrained from selling in case the personal Estate can pay all, so if it will pay part proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably according to reasonable circumstances, in that Case they may sell, and not otherwise. <hi>Quaere</hi> therefore if the Executors should not be made Parties.</item>

And it was then farther ordered, that the Party should attend the Right Honourable the Lord Keéper of the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for his Lordships Directions, Whether the Principal and Interest should be paid to the Defendant <hi>John Baker</hi> the Heir, or to the Defendant <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Relict and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratrix of the said <hi>James Baker;</hi> since which the said Principal and Interest having been paid by the Plaintiff, and a Reconveyance made unto them, but the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Heir and the Administratrix being not setled, Now upon hearing and full debating of the matter this present day by Counsel learned, as well for the Heir as the Administratrix, whether the said Principal Mony and Interest doth belong, and ought to be paid to the Heir or Administratrix, and the former Presidents being produced, the Lord Keéper having béen attended with the said Cause and Presidents, and having taken time to consider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, did now declare, that the Mortgage ought to go to the other Defendant <hi>John Nichols</hi> and his Wife, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministratrix of <hi>James Baker,</hi> and not to <hi>John Baker</hi> Son and Heir of the said <hi>James Baker;</hi> because the Reason of the Common Law in these Cases ought as near as may be to be followed in Equity.<note place="margin">Equitas sequitur Legem.</note> Now by the Common Law, if the Conditions or Defeazance of a Mortgage of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be so penned, that no mention is made either of Heirs or Executors to whom the Mony should be paid, in that case
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42102:147"/>the Mony ought to be paid to the Executrix, in regard that the Mony came first out of the Personal Estate, and therefore usually returns thither again;<note place="margin">Where the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Mony shall be paid to the Heir or the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, in Law or Equity. Elective.</note> but if the Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance appoints the Mony to be paid either to Heirs or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors disjunctively, there by the Common Law if the Mortgagor pay the Mony precisely at the day, he may elect to pay it either to the Heirs or Executors, as he pleaseth: But where the precise day is past, and the Mortgage forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all Election is gone in Law, for in Law there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Then when the Case is reduced to an Equity of Redemption, that Redemption is not to be upon payment to the Heirs or Executors of the Mortgagee at the Election of the Mortgagor, for it were against Equity to revive that Election, for then the Mortgagor might defer the payment as long as he pleaseth, and at last for a composition by payment of the Mony to that Hand which will use him best, much less can the Court elect or direct the payment where they please, for a Power so Arbitrary might be attended with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies throughout. Therefore to have a certain Rule in these Cases, and a better cannot be chose than to come as near unto the Rule and Reason of the Common Law as may be. Now the Law always gives the Mony to the Executor where no Person is named, and where the Election to pay to either Heir or Executor is gone and forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Law,<note place="margin">The nature of a Mortgage.</note> 'tis all one in Equity as if either Heir or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor were named, and then Equity ought to follow the Law and give it to the Executor, for in natural Justice and Equity the principal right of the Mortgagee is to the Mony, and his right of the Land is only as a security for the Mony; wherefore when the security descends to the Heir of the Mortgagée, attended with an Equity of Redemption, as soon as the Mortgagor pays the Mony the Lands belong to him, and only the Mony to the Mortgageé, which is meérly personal, and so accrews to the Executors or Administrators of the Mortgagee.<note place="margin">Mortgage of an Inheritance to a Citizen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> part of his Personal Estate.</note> And for this reason a Mortgage of an Inheritance to a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> hath been held to be part of his Personal Estate, and divided according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom. And tho it may seem hard that the Heir should part the Land, and be decreed to make a Recompence without having the Mony which comes in lieu of the Land, yet it will not seem so to them who consider that the Land was never more than a Security, and that after payment of the Mony the Law keeps a Trust for the Mortgage, which the Heir of the Mortgagee is bound to execute; and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42102:148"/>declared that the Right to a Sum of Mony, which is a Personal Duty, ought always to be certain, and not to be variable upon circumstances. Wherefore his Lordship did not think it material that the Administratrix in this Case had Assets without this Mony, for Assets or not Assets is not the measure of Iustice to Executor or Administrator, but serves only as a pretence to favour the Heir, who either ought to have the Mony if there be no Assets, or not to have it tho there be Assets. And for the same reason his Lordship did not think it material that there wanted Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of a Personal Covenant from the Mortgagor to pay the Mony, for that the Case of the Administratrix of the Mortgagee had been stronger with it, yet it is strong enough without it. His Lordship declared that he had consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the various Presidents in this Case which had been urged, whereof one did not come to the very Point, there being a great difference between a Mortgagee and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Conveyance with a Collateral Agreement to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey upon repayment of the Purchase Mony,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee and an absolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance with a Collateral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convey.</note> the other late Presidents which made for the Heir being contrary to the more ancient Presidents of this Court, and to some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Prsidents also, which seemed to his Lordship of more weight, his Lordship being of Opinion that all Mortgages ought to be looked upon as part of the Personal Estate, unless the Mortgagor in his life time,<note place="margin">Mortgages lookt upon as part of the Personal Estate.</note> or by his last Will do otherwise declare and dispose of the same. Wherefore, and upon the whole matter, his Lordship having fully weighed the Presidents, and what was said on either side, Doth order and decree that the Mortgage Mony and Interest shall be paid unto the said <hi>John Nichols</hi> and his Wife, and kept by them, and that what Security hath been given by either of them concerning the disposing of the said Monies and Interest, or the abiding the Order of this Court, as to the payment of the said Mony and Inetrest, be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to them and cancelled.</p>

               <p>The Lady <hi>Isabel</hi> by Will appoints payment of the <hi>6000 l.</hi> to the Plaintiffs, and others, and she dieth. <hi>Nicholas</hi> on treaty of Marriage to be had with the Countess and <hi>4000 l.</hi> Portion, covenants to levy a Fine of the said Manors to the use of <hi>Nicholas</hi> for life, the Remainder to the Defendant for her life for her Iointure, the Remainder over in Tail.</p>
               <p>In this Assurance are the Incumbrances excepted of the ninety nine years, and <hi>6000 l.</hi> Daughters Portions in the Deéd <hi>1649.</hi> and the Mortgage made to Sir <hi>Thomas Hewet</hi> for <hi>2000 l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bill is now to have the other Sum of <hi>6000 l.</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the Deéd <hi>1653.</hi> and appointment thereof by <hi>Isabel Harvey</hi> surviving Trustee of the first ninety nine years, and the Lesseés by the Deéd <hi>1653.</hi> for ninety nine years, and the Lady Iointress are Parties.</p>
               <p>The Cause was formerly heard, and a Decrée pronounced by the Lord Chancellor for the Plaintiffs, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by him with great earnestness, and not without some reflection on the Defendants Councel, as if the Fee was more regarded than the Iustice of the Cause.</p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:42102:150"/>
               <p> The Points moved were, That the Trust to raise the <hi>6000 l.</hi> in question was appointed to be raised out of an Estate for ninety nine years, which falls out to be a void Estate; for it is for the same Term when the former Estate for ninety nine years to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> did commence <hi>(viz)</hi> after the death of <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Isabel,</hi> which now in event of the Cause (<hi>Nicholas</hi> having no Issue by <hi>Isabel</hi>) falls out to have the same beginning and ending with the former; but two Terms at one time cannot be in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the same time; and the Limitation is not that the said Manors shall be to those Vses, but the Trust seems to be restrained to the Estate of ninety nine years limited by the Deéd, and to those Persons <hi>(viz.) Russel, Rich</hi> and <hi>Lake,</hi> who should during the Term to them limited, raise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And where there was no Estate, no Trust could be annexed, nor could there be Trusteés of that Estate which had no being: It were to suppose <hi>Accidens subsistere sine substantivo in quo existat,</hi> and it were <hi>Coloratum sine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore;</hi> and it could not be equitable to make the first ninety nine years liable to this <hi>6000 l.</hi> for there is no such thing appointed by the first ninety nine years. And the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff here claims by a voluntary Conveyance without any Agreement or Contract precedent for the doing thereof; but the Defendants claim upon a valuable consideration of <hi>4000 l.</hi> Marriage and Iointure: And tis a hard strain to translate a Trust charged particularly on an Estate of ninety nine years, which is a void Estate beyond the words express to another Estate; for though in truth <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> might have charged the first ninety nine years after the first <hi>6000 l.</hi> charged thereon, yet he did not do it: And the mention that the Deéds <hi>1651</hi> and <hi>1653.</hi> were for a Portion of Mony paid, that is untrue, for no more was paid than what was paid and satisfied by the former Settlement <hi>1649.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor decreed the contrary, That the Trust of the last <hi>6000 l.</hi> should be charged on the first ninety nine years. For <hi>Nicholas</hi> intended the raising there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and had power to charge the first ninety nine years therewith after the other <hi>6000 l.</hi> raised, and regarded only the Parties intent to raise the Mony, though he pitched not on proper means.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:42102:150"/>
               <p> But it was objected, that the Plaintiffs Title being vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and the Defendants for valuable Considerations, the Plaintiffs Title <hi>prima facie</hi> is fraudnlent against a Purchaser.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor said, A voluntary Conveyance may be good and not fraudulent, and that from the Circumstances of persons of Honour who are Trustées, and concluded it not fraudulent.</p>
               <p>And though he was prest to direct a Tryal at Law on that Point, would not do it, for whether fraudulent or not, it is not proper for this Court.</p>
               <p>The Defendant being a Purchaser had no Notice of the Trust on the last Lease or Estate for ninety nine years, and so not bound by it clearly, she nor her Friends having no actual notice: And the rather for that the Deed of <hi>1651.</hi> was revoaked, and so is recited to be. And there is indeéd mention that an Estate was to be created to <hi>Russel, Rich</hi> and <hi>Lake,</hi> and their Heirs, but no mention that there was any new Estate for ninety nine years to be made to them, nor of the Trust to raise the <hi>6000 l.</hi> herein mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Recital of the Deed which does refer to the Incumbrance, is notice against a Purchaser.</note>But my Lord Chancellor declared, that there was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient notice in Law, or an implyed notice; for the Mortgage to <hi>Hewet</hi> was excepted in the Defendants Conveyance, and therefore they could not be ignorant of the Mortgage, and ought to have seen that, and that would have led them to the other Deeds, in which, pursued from one to another, the whole Case must have béen discovered to them.</p>
               <p>But against this it was objected, that the Defendant could not inforce the Mortgagée to shew his assurances, nor would any Mortgagée so do; and when there was only <hi>2000 l.</hi> due, thereon, which the Ioyntresses Friends were content to be charged with, there was no reason to enquire further, especially into things collateral to the Mortgagées Estate. Besides, notice to charge a Purchaser ought to be perfect and compleat, and there was no means for such notice; for two things were to be notified, <hi>(viz)</hi> a Power to charge the <hi>6000 l.</hi> and Execution of that Power, of which there was no colour, nor no means to be informed. For <hi>Isabels</hi> power was general to limit the <hi>6000 l.</hi> to any person or persons at any time by Déed or Will; so the Enquiry was uncertain and almost impossible to find out.</p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:42102:151"/>
               <p> Mr. <hi>Keck</hi> prest it much, that it was without President, that a voluntary Conveyance should be decreéd against a Purchaser for valuable consideration. Purchasers were ever favoured by the Court.</p>
               <p>My Lord Chancellor was not moved with this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

               <p>The Question was, Whether the <hi>400 l.</hi> being discharged in Law to the Executor, should be accounted as part of the Residue, there being no néed of it to pay Debts or Legacies particularly given; for the Testator must not be supposed ignorant, but knowing of the Law, that by making his Debtor Executor he thereby discharged the Debt, and so the <hi>400 l.</hi> became no part of the personal Estate, and so no Residue thereof.

               <p>The Bill is for Relief that the Plaintiff <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Peter</hi> the younger, may be relieved; for the Profits of one third of the Lands setled in possession in Fee to her Husband, and the Infant to have the other two Parts of the Inheritance of all according to the Marriage Agreément and Deed in pursuance thereof. <hi>Peter</hi> by Answer denyed the Settlement, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Son did so also, and that he had no notice of the Agréement, and made Title to the Lands by a former Marriage Settlement on the Marriage of <hi>Peter</hi> the Father, to the Father of <hi>Peter</hi> for life, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the first, second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sons of <hi>Peter,</hi> in Tail, to the Heirs Males, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so as <hi>Peter,</hi> who made the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which the Plaintiffs claim, was but Tenant for life, Remainder to <hi>Peter</hi> the Son in Tail, Remainder to <hi>Henry</hi> the Defendant, second Son of that Marriage, and to <hi>Peter</hi> the first. And so <hi>Peter</hi> the first Son being dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Issue Male, the Land remained to him. But a Recovery was produced by the Plaintiff, suffered by <hi>Peter</hi> the younger, that he objected against the Recovery, because the Father was Tenant for life, and survived not.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff had a Decree according to the Bill, and confirmed on Re-hearing of the Cause in <hi>Hill. 28 Car. 2.</hi> by the Lord Chancellor, because the Father supprest and got into his hands the Writing, which was done for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for he needed not have so done for <hi>Henry's</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and where Deeds are supprest <hi>omnia praesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentur.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> Francis Hill <hi>against Sir</hi> Robert Carr. November 6.</head>
               <p>SIR <hi>Robert Carr</hi> covenanted with Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to secure <hi>6000 l.</hi> to Sir <hi>Francis</hi> in consideration of marrying his Sister. Much Debate was formerly whether it was a Covenant, and so obliging to Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> or no; and Iudges assisting, there was a difference in Opinion in the Point, that it was a Covenant; for whereever the intent of the Parties could be collected out of a Déed for the not doing or doing a thing, a Covenant will lie: And the Chancellor declared his Opinion to be so.<note place="margin">In what Cases Action of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will lie.</note> And a Covenant will lie on a Bond, for it proves an Agréement. And for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Security a Fine of certain Manors to be levyed by Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and a Decrée was pronounced accordingly. But on Re-hearing it was questioned whether the Decreé should be for the Fine to be levyed presently,<note place="margin">Decree for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Mony which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whether the Security shall be given before the Account stated.</note> or till the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count betwéen Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and the Plaintiff setled; for Sir <hi>Francis</hi> had received some Mony. And it was prest by the Defendants Counsel, that till the Account past, the Duty was uncertain.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> That Sir <hi>Robert</hi> by levying a Fine Tenant in Tail should subject his Estate to other Iudgments and Statutes. It was answered, Security ought to precéed Payment; and if he were subject to other Statutes they were his own Debts; And his Act ought not to prejudice Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> who was intitled to have a Fine by Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> his own Covenant, and there was no reason the Court should hazard the Plaintiffs Debt, lest Sir <hi>Robert</hi> should be made subject to other Debts.</p>
               <p>But the Lord Chancellor declared, as he after decreed for the Reasons, <hi>ut supra,</hi> that the Fine should be respited till the Account setled.</p>
               <p>It was objected, that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> being Tenant in Tayl, if he should dye before the Account setled, the Issue in Tayl will not be bound by the Decrée.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Covenant to levy a Fine, and a Decree that he shall so do, binds the Issue in Tail.</note>But the Lord Chancellor answered, that the Covenant being to levy a Fine upon valuable consideration, and a Decrée in pursuance thereof, the Decrée will bind the Issue, seeing the Father of Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had power by Fine to bar the Issue.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:42102:152"/>
               <p> And another Matter was, the Defendant was left to his Remedy at Law on the Land by way of Covenant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover such Damages only as he had sustained by not setling the Ioynture on his Wife, though she was now dead.</p>
               <p>And we objected, that this Bond was for the Wifes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in Trust for her.</p>

But on the other side divers Speeches of his Fathers were proved, that it was his Sons, and the Son by his Will gave the Manor to his Father for Life; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Spéeches also by the Son and Father that the Manor was <hi>Thomas</hi> his Manor, and the Father proved the said Will, being Executor.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:42102:153"/>
               <p> The Question was, Whether the Purchase was a Trust in <hi>Thomas</hi> for the Father, or an Advancement by the Father to the Son. And decréed an Advancement, not a Trust. And whereas the Father did after the death of <hi>Tho.</hi> convey <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> and three other Manors in Trust to raise <hi>2000 l.</hi> for two other of his Grandchildren, <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Charles, Gosfield</hi> was not liable thereto.</p>
               <p>Another Question was: <hi>Ralph</hi> Father of <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> and of <hi>Ford,</hi> did make a Conveyance of <hi>Gosfield</hi> to Trustees and their Heirs, to pay his Debts and Legacies; and after for performance of his Will, and at the same time made his Will, and thereby did devise the Trustees to pay <hi>2000 l.</hi> apiece to <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> and also <hi>6000 l.</hi> to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> his Daughter, the Surplus after to his Heir <hi>Ford,</hi> and made his Wife one of the Defendants Executrix, but gave her not thereby in Terms the personal Estate,<note place="margin">Personal Estate in aid of the Heirs.</note> but only made her Executrix; and devised that his said thrée Children should release to his Executrix all such Actions and Demands of his personal Estate to his Executrix. Now the Question was, whether the Executrix should be lyable to the Legacies of the Children in aid of the Heir, who had the Surplus of <hi>Gosfield</hi> that was to be sold?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lands devised for payment of Debts and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Estate shall be first applyed.</note>As to the Creditors it was agréed, she must be liable; but as to the Childrens Legacies there ought to be no aid for the Heir; for when the Legatees were by the Will to release all demands out of, or to the personal Estate, they could make no demand out of it, which shews his intent, that therefore as to the Interest and Legacies the personal Estate was to be discharged, and the Executrix to enjoy the Estate free against them, and therefore the Heir not to charge the Executrix as for those Legacies of which he discharged his Executrix, especially having otherwise provided for their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And the Surplus to the Heir is expresly after Debts and Lagacies paid; therefore not before.</p>
               <p>Against which it was said, that regularly the personal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state must aid the Heir, and an implyed intent must not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clear Expression alter the equitable general Law.</p>
               <p>And there were other Reasons for the Release to be given <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Estate was in the Province of <hi>York,</hi> lyable to the Children for Portions.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor decréed the personal Estate to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in aid of the Heir in order to aid him for what he should be charged withal, not only as to the Creditors, but as to the Legacies charged on <hi>Gosfield (viz.)</hi> the <hi>6000 l.</hi> to the younger Children.</p>

                  <hi>Hinton</hi> in his Answer confest the Agreément, but that it was qualified, and part of the Agreément was, that <hi>Hinton</hi> should be counter-secured by their Bonds against the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors to whom he was bound, and that he was dampnified for want of such Counter-security; for that he had been sued and forced to pay the Creditors <hi>3000 l.</hi> and produced the Bonds whereon he paid the Mony cancelled; but he had no Witness that proved expresly that part of the Agréement touching Counter-security, but proved four Bonds of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersecurity sealed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and left with the Scrivener, but not to be delivered till Matters agréed by <hi>Hinton</hi> and <hi>Butcher.</hi>

               <p>The Lord Chancellor. Take it for granted, that what <hi>Butcher</hi> did he agreed to do; or else he would not have done it.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the Defendant insisted, that the Agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being voluntary,<note place="margin">A voluntary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement not obliging in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity unless all be performed.</note> unless all that should have beén per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed were performed, the Defendant should not be bound thereby in Equity, and his good Security taken from him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>E contra,</hi> It was said, that the Agreément was to give Bond, not to pay the Mony; for the Bond once given binds to payment, and the failer of <hi>Short</hi> to give Security may not prejudice <hi>Butcher,</hi> who did: And the Caution to the Scrivener must be intended of the relate to, not the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up the <hi>12000 l.</hi> Bond; for no Reason to counterse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and become doubly bound for the same Debt, but ought first to be discharged of the old Bond and Debt.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor. This Debate assures me that <hi>Short</hi> has failed, or else the Contention is vain; and the Agreément not being fully performed, I cannot take away <hi>Hintons</hi> legal Security and pay him with Parchment; and <hi>Hinton</hi> had little avail by the Agreement, being bound in the new Bond.</p>

               <p>The Wife to protect her self against the Statute <hi>pendente lite,</hi> after the Bill exhibited, procured an Assignment of the first Statute, and set it forth by Answer. Against which, Proof was made by the Plaintiff, that the Defendant, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the present Husband,<note place="margin">Antiquity of a Statute answered by being proved and Interest paid</note> who married her when a Widow, had after the Bill forged and falsified the Church Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it would appear that the Statute was not acknowledged by the Besail, as the Defendant pretended, and who after the Statute purchased the Land, but by the Besail of the same Name.

And the Covenant to save harmless is no Debt, but only rests in Damages. And to the Sentence in Law we are no Party, nor ever acquainted with it. And by what Evidence or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42102:161"/>faint defence made by <hi>Gold</hi> the Sentence was given, we know not. And it is more probable when <hi>Gold</hi> had his Mony in our Hands, he on design to pay himself out of our Mony in his Hands made faint or no defence. And its improbable that the Dukes Officers should be so long negligent of the Dues to the Duke, and the Plaintiff should have given notice to the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor. Whether the Bill of Exchange was before or after the Sentence doth not appear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorny objected. This is like a foreign Attachment to pay due on one Account, or occasion out of another, and the Mony is not due from <hi>Canham</hi> only, but also from <hi>Lee</hi> till at last it was answered, that <hi>Canhams</hi> Covenant extends to all which <hi>Golds</hi> part suffered.</p>
               <p>And decreed accordingly.</p>
